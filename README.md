An example of our project can be found at project.ipynb, and this example notebook highlights our XGBoost classifier performances. 
The required data to run the notebook is 10.463 MB in size and can be found in ./classifiers and ./labeling_data.
The notebook can be run in linear order to achieve the desired results of seeing the distribution of the 2800 labeled posts across all 12 categories, 
loading in the classifiers that were trained on the labeled data, loading the hidden states of the labeled posts, and obtaining the
AUC scores for the models.
