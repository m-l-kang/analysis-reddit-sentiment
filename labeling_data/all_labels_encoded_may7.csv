A few questions-- I got admitted in a weird way,"Hello, I am a transfer student that TAG'D UCI last year. I had all the requirements/GPA etc but I was still denied. I met with a counselor like 2 weeks ago, we went over my stuff and he contacted UCI admissions. They said there was a mistake and accepted me. But now I feel a little lost because I was accepted so late and I wasn't even on a wait list. So a few questions

Since I got accepted June 2nd I missed the guaranteed housing app. I still applied for housing at AV, what are my chances of getting it? I'd really love to live there, commuting to my CC destroyed my willpower sometimes. 

On myAid, I try to view my reward but I still have the ""we have filed your app and you will receive your reward shortly"" how long will this take to update? 

On my transfer app, I put that I was going to take a history course during summer. Turns out I don't even need it, I had 60 units + required GPA + major requirements done. My major is comp Sci, I won't get rescinded for that right? I'm just stressing, I'm super happy that I got accepted and don't want it to be ruined for any reason. 

What courses in the upper div CS are considered weed out or insanely difficult? 


Why can't I sign into my UCI email? It says my account isn't found. I'm using my UCInetID like it says. I need to log into it to check housing updates. I think it has something to do with me being denied then accepted. 

And for final transcripts, can I just bring them to admissions in person? Or Mail only. I love the campus and usually find excuses just to go there. 

Sorry if the questions are stupid or obvious, I was admitted under such short notice so everything is overwhelming. ",4mhh8p, Housing ;<br> Admissions ;<br> Academic , Admissions ;<br> Academic ;<br> Social life , Admissions , Admissions , Admissions ;<br> Academic ," ADMISSIONS

Viability of TIM major?,"Just wondering if anyone has any information on the TIM major as a whole, especially compared to the CompSci major here and the Information Technology major at other schools?

I was originally planning on majoring in IT but TIM was the closest thing offered by UCSC. However it worries me that there seem to be only a handful of other TIM majors.

I'm only a freshman so I'm trying to get an idea of whether I should change my plans before it's too late - I've already taken two Economics classes but it shouldn't be too late to make a switch to Computer Science.

I'm honestly not one hundred percent sure what I want to do with myself after I graduate: I've heard some people say that it's a lot harder to get a programming job as a TIM major compared to a CompSci major? But I wasn't planning on programming, the plan was originally to find work in IT...

I've considered transferring (Irvine has an IT program) but apparently inter-UC transfers get bottom priority.

I'm really just looking for any help or guidance from someone with experience in the TIM major or the IT field...",2x74s1, Admissions ;<br> Academic ,, Academic , Academic , Academic ," ACADEMIC

2. if i do take writing 39b, do the professors usually teach the same theme every quarter? i can't find the theme list for this upcoming quarter and i really don't want to take some previous themes that were offered. also what professors are good because writing isn't really my favorite thing.
3. what bio 94 and chem 1b professors are good? i'm trying to avoid online classes though, because i tend to do worse in them overall.

CSE Schools: ICS or Engineering which is better?,"I am deciding which school to change my major to (I only get to choose one). I know it doesn't matter, but which do you think is better? I'm hearing different things.

2. Enrollment to EECS: Engineering is easier to get into classes
3. There seem to be fewer ICS students than Engineering for CSE majors. Perhaps that's better?

I am currently a freshman attending a Texas university with a biology major and as the title says, I am very interested in going to graduate school at UCLA.

As a side note, I am planning to get into their Environmental Health Science or Biology graduate program.

*My friend got into UCLA's Urban Planning graduate program with a full ride and a 3.7-3.8 GPA and she graduated from UT Austin. Is there a chance that will happen to me also? I currently have a high GPA (not telling you guys what exactly it is). 

*How are the Biology and Environmental Science graduate programs are? I think that UCLA is one of the few graduate schools that offer Environmental Health Science graduate program.

"Transcript issue, might be a problem","Hey, I'm a transfer student looking to a transfer in the fall. A few summers ago, I took a summer class at a different community college than the one I normally attended, and I failed the class. I realized a few days ago that I didn't report that I had taken that class, or that I had attended that school at all. So my question is, do they have a way of seeing that I had attended this school if I don't send my transcript from that school in? Am I screwed?

Edit: Would it be a good idea to fill out the form to update my transcript with that class? It was a calc class but I've since changed my major away from STEM field so I don't really need it.

Last edit: Thanks for the advice all. The dude at my school's transfer counseling center said that, even if they don't figure out that I attended the other school before transferring, it would come up when it comes time for me to graduate and it would be a bigger problem then. So I'm gonna be transparent and hope for the best. ",8oorzp, Academic , Academic ,,,, ACADEMIC ,['ACADEMIC'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

applying this fall,"Hello,

I am going into my second year of Community College, and one of my top choices is UCI. My GPA is around a 3.4 atm but should be back up around the 3.5-3.6 range after fall. I plan on applying this fall for Business Economics. 

I have retaken a class, however I ended with a B my second try. I also have had an Internship (that I plan on doing again in the spring) 70+ hours of community service, and a job. As for my academic achievements,  I plan on finishing my schools honors program by the time I transfer, along with the schools Business Admin AA, and Economics AA (maybe one more based off the classes ive taken for GE). 

I unfortunately decided to overload my summer with classes and work. I took Calc 1 w Analytic Geometry, Business Law and Business Information Systems. I finish my Business classes w/ an A and a B, however I finished Calc w a C. According to assist.org, I am required to finish my prerequisite classes w/ a B or higher.

I planned on finishing the Calc Series by the time I graduate and I have completed all my other Prerequisite classes with other recommended classes with A’s and one B. I know I can get a B or better in the remaining Calc classes. 

Am I completely out of a chance w/ UCI because of the C? It will (hopefully) be my only C by the time I transfer, and I feel like the rest of my achievements have made me competitive. Is there still hope?

TL;DR
Got a C in a Prerequisite class when UCI only accepts B’s or higher, am I out of a chance?",ckteb1, Admissions ;<br> Academic , Admissions ;<br> Academic ,,, Admissions ," ADMISSIONS

"Withdrawal, Social Sciences, Study Abroad, and ACC Apartments","Hey folks, so I am planning on withdrawing for winter and spring quarters for financial and mental health purposes.

Also, does anyone have experience with withdrawing and being readmitted to the school of social sciences? I know some departments will auto readmit you as long as you're in good standing and apply within a year but social science has no info online.

Finally, this is a bit specific, but if I'm not currently enrolled, can I still apply for study abroad for next year. I'd like to go next winter/spring but the application is due when I will be withdrawn. Would they make an exception?

Why didn't USAC place all the proposed Constitutional Amendments on the ballot?,"A month or so ago, a petition circulated to place several new constitutional amendments on the USAC elections ballot. It didn't receive the requisite 4500 signatures (as no petition ever has) to be placed on the ballot by students, so it was USAC's decision on whether or not to place these propositions on the ballot.

Transfer student representative Zuleika Bravo says in the comments of [this Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uclatransfers/permalink/10157929251327694/), [""we will let the students decide on the ballot how they wish to vote when it comes to the Constitution because that is how it should be. USAC should not be making that decision.""](https://i.gyazo.com/3ef9e1d96450074cddd22cfdd36c2a08.png)

But then today, only 2 of the 10 proposed amendments from the petition made it onto the USAC ballot (questions 2 and 4 from the petition becoming questions 1 and 3 on the ballot).

My question to USAC is, why shouldn't students have the option to vote on most of these amendments? Is letting the students decide on the ballot how they wish to vote when it comes to the Constitution *not* how it should be? Should USAC be the only entity making that decision?",n20ov8, Unclassified , Social life ,,, Social life ," SOCIAL LIFE

Chem 1LC,"Chem 1LC is the first in person lab for a majority of undergraduates since we were underclassmen in highschool. Still, there has been no clear direction or help without the prof being extremely condescending to students who have NEVER been inside a lab before or used the terrible software interfaces we are required to pay for to pass this lab. Some TAs give far more help than others and others even tell students to do the wrong thing without knowing. 

Also, as of today the prof has shortened the time we have to troubleshoot/complete assignments by TWO HOURS which doesn’t allow for students who have wifi/tech problems or even students who work diligently to complete assignments on time without completely rushing. I feel like I can’t even use the bathroom or breathe during lab because it wastes too much time. It is extremely stress inducing for everyone in the class but it doesn’t need to be this way. No class should have an 11% would take again rating on rate my professor. What can students do to change this because everytime we try to explain that the rules are unclear or nearly impossible to follow we get shot down?? I’m thinking a petition or something that will help the prof to realize that we are human and baby stem students who are making valid arguments against the new policy.",ty1gff, Academic , Academic ,,, Academic , ACADEMIC ,['ACADEMIC'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Remember 2 years ago when they said that the pandemic would last 2 weeks?,""" Anticipating this surge, and recognizing that many of us travel and celebrate in groups during the holidays, the Chancellor announced last month that instruction during the first two weeks of the winter quarter, **January 3 through 14,** will be remote. This gives us time to properly assess our environment through testing, sequestration, and retesting. "" -zotmail@uci

That sounds really familiar... hmmm

Reminds me of a quote

 “**Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.**”  - George Santayana 

Here we go again...

Edit: this was supposed to be a joke on how this entire pandemic was supposed to last only 2 weeks and then extended to 2 years.

To make things weirder, I also got an increase in my grant money?? Can you receive enough grant money that it negates your eligibility for a loan?

Why is it so hard for me to make friends in UCLA?,"I am a junior transfer student from a local community college. I have made a lot of good friends back in my CC and I thought that it would be the same once I transferred here - And boy, was I wrong. I have tried to make small talks to my classmates, joined clubs and went to social events on campus. 
Still, I have made only 2-3 friends from my last quarter... since most of people who I have talked to and met in class/clubs/campus events only remained as shallow ""acquaintances"": They would usually act friendly and nice, some would even exchange phone numbers with you, but the next time you see them, they would act like they don't know you or smile at you while walking away.
wtf?? That is seriously the weirdest phenomenon I have experienced at this school. Does anyone have similar experiences? What are some of the advices you would give to people who are currently in this kind of situation? Thanks.

Life at UCLA,"Hi all! I'm a transfer student and was recently accepted into UCLA as a chemistry major. Naturally, I have a few questions before I make my decision. Feel free to answer any/all as you see fit:
1) If you are a chemistry major, what is the rigor of upper div classes like? is it really difficult to maintain a 3.5+ GPA? How competitive are the classes?
2) What are your favorite places to study on campus? Off campus?
3) What are the locations of the best restrooms to take a dump in peace?
4) Back to academics, what are your most effective ways of studying? I'm coming from a semester school and would like to have a leg up on the transition to quarters.
5) How do you avoid burnout during the quarters?
6) How do you join a research professor's team this late in the game as a Junior transfer?
7) What are some fun things to do on a Friday night around campus/LA (excluding clubbing/partying)?
8) Is there an app for the bus schedules going to and from campus?
9) Lastly, do you have any other pieces of advice? I'm highly considering UCLA so anything will help.

I was just wondering if anyone would like to study tonight or tomorrow morning before the midterm just to bounce ideas off of one another and further cement existing knowledge. Personally, I find it very helpful to try and teach or rehash the material in order to make sure that I have it down.

I'm a third year looking to make friends at UCI,"Hi everybody!  


I'm a third year at UCI that's looking to make friends on campus.  I don't really have friends on campus, and I'm about to graduate. The truth is, I was so focused on studying and I stayed in my apartment so much that I never really made friends on campus and I don't really talk to people in my classes. I also never really kept in contact with my previous roommates. I'm starting to look back on it and I definitely regret it, and I wish I had made more of an effort to keep in touch with people. I can't change the past, but I can make an effort to change the future.

UCI Sociology experience,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a student from OCC and will most likely be committing to UCI as a Sociology major. If there are any current Sociology majors right now or those that are graduating, what was the experience like and did you enjoy it? Long story short, I used to really dread UCI and just Irvine in general because of how 'basic' it is. The clean, minimal aesthetic Irvine has sometimes looked sterile. Also, the thought of never escaping or leaving Socal makes me feel doomed (dramatic, I know). But since UCI is giving me financial aid/offer that I just can't refuse, I'm thinking I need to give UCI/Irvine a chance. Anything helps, though I prefer hearing from Social Sciences/Humanities majors. Thank you so much!!

Update: Thank you to everybody that responded. After visiting the campus for the first time in forever, I actually ended up really liking it. On another note, I stopped by the book store, specifically the textbook area and all the course materials were so interesting!! Submitted the SIR today :') Happy to say that I've made my peace with Irvine (here and there, lol) and am excited for the fall.",ur49ns,, Academic ,,, Academic , ACADEMIC ,['ACADEMIC'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All aspects of treatment and pre-treatment assessment will be **virtual via Zoom video-call**. *This is a free treatment study, and participants can receive up to $205 for participating.*

If you have serious body image and eating concerns this is a great opportunity to work on them, so please contact us!  **Below is the link for the questionnaire to determine your eligibility.** Look forward to hearing from you. This is best for people in **northern California/Bay Area that otherwise couldn't travel to Palo Alto.**

"IAMA UC Irvine Economics Grad (2013), and took advantage of my time around Orange County. Here for advice on classes, must visit spots around campus/OC, life after college, etc. AMA!","I hope the moderators don't mind me taking up space on our subreddit doing something like this. 

Long story short- Recently, I had a really neat experience where I ran into a fellow reddit-or and was able to answer some questions to help him make a enrollment decision (UC Irvine v UC Davis). He has since decided to become an Anteater this fall!

As an alum (sort of recent, 2013) I wanted to field questions from any new Anteaters or anyone attending UC Irvine and set to graduate soon. 

During my time - I was heavily involved on campus and look back on my time at UCI fondly. I am an avid explorer and searcher of good eats. I probably logged a good 40,000 miles traveling through and around OC/So. California; being a Nor. California native, I wanted visit everywhere I could before coming back home.

After UCI, I went to work for the NBA. I'm now in a position more fit for what I majored in. UC Irvine surely set me up well (moreso network and socially).

If anything - Let me know how I can help make your time at UC Irvine enjoyable.

Best college for me socially?,"Hey all, I could really use some advice on which college to pick.

One of the reasons I chose to attend UCSC was because it's far from home and I'm a pretty introverted, shy person and am hoping to become more outgoing by forcing myself into a situation that would foster development of more social behavior. The two main colleges I'm looking at now are Crown and Cowell. Crown seems like the best fit for me, but I'm worried that living in a college with a more nerdy reputation would run counter to the goals I mentioned above. Cowell is basically the reverse, not sure if I would fit in there, but it would be more conducive to some of the things I want out of college.

Here's some more about me:

* Don't smoke like at all, I know wherever I go I'll probably encounter it, but the less the better. My brother smokes so I can handle it if I need to
* Majoring in Computer Engineering
* Don't really like super artsy people, or hippies/activist types
* Somewhat into nerd culture/computers, but hoping to try new things, not really too much of a gamer
* I'm a minority, but am not really concerned about diversity, like at all, race doesn't matter very much to me
* Again hoping to become more social
* Am christian, if that makes any difference, not interested in forcing my beliefs onto people though, accepting

I don't know how often posts like these show up, but I'd really appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance.",8kxmjf,, Social life ,,, Admissions ;<br> Social life ," SOCIAL LIFE

Any knowledge of safe parking spots, or streets near UCLA you've seen lots of RV's, or other help would be appr.! Also a short message for Alumni/PhySci.","Honestly this is a shot in the dark here. I was hoping maybe a current student could get back to me. Maybe you have seen RV's parked somewhere near campus, or know someone to call for more information. I could benefit from literally any info about now since I'll be going down there very soon, on starting on June 30th.

&amp;#x200B;

What little I have gathered searching online:

1 - A comment on another post says people maybe parking and living in their cars on veteran but I have no way to confirm this, or whether the laws have changed since that was posted.

2 - Found some [laws on vehicle dwelling in LA](https://lacity.gov/residents/community-assistance/homeless-services). The parking-restriction thing is a wildcard which makes things impossible to plan out simply because you must obey all parking restrictions. Normally this would not phase me but were talking about west LA here near the university.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading and sorry if this has offended in any way. I've heard that LA's homelessness problem has only gotten worse and I just hope this isn't taken the wrong way. Normally I would have money for a sublet from my medical school loans, but I am a returning student from a leave of absence and have not received any funds as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I just want to send my fellow UCLA alumni good vibes and a short message. I can't say much for other majors, but I chose UCLA over other equal or ""higher ranked"" schools for a science major and continued there for my master's degree and I'm so happy I did. Y'all are getting a world class education with many opportunities for work and research experience. If any fellow PhySci majors happen upon this post feel free to PM me for anything, but particularly if interested in research or pursuing a master's/PhD since I've only been involved in that capacity since 2015-ish. My PI is chill, works on many organ systems, and is (seemingly) always looking for more students to show the lab or help with experiments; especially if you're serious about pursuing graduate school.

&amp;#x200B;

mesa court vs middle earth? // class of 2025 *zot zot zot*,"A little about me:

1. I am interested in either a triple or quad (which housing has more space for triple or quad typa rooms? Are quads more crammed than triples? I am interested in quads so I can make more friends.)
2. How's the bathroom situation? How many people do you normally have to share the bathroom with and is it difficult to share the bathroom with so many people? How often are the bathrooms cleaned?
3. I am a CS major (i'm not going to pick middle earth just because it's closer to ICS) I kinda want to  live at Mesa so I can take a longer walk to attend my ICS classes.
4. I am planning on joining a sorority and heard more ppl that are part of sororities live in mesa court (but I saw this info on 4 year old reddit posts) Can someone confirm this?
5. Which dorm is more sociable?
6. Should I dorm in middle earth because it has newer facilities?
7. How's the dining at Mesa Court (Anteatery) vs. Middle Earth (Brandyvine)? I am a vegetarian so does one dining hall have more vegetarian options than the other or is it relatively the same?
8. Regular dorms or towers? Is it worth the extra buck for the towers? Do towers have better bathrooms and more space?

Unhappy at ucr,"Hi, I am posting since it’s gonna be anonymous. I wonder if there are people who are like me, and how they did deal with it. I just transferred to UCR on last quarter from out of state and 3rd year computer science major. (Just started 3rd year on this quarter) I found myself very unhappy and miserable at UCR. The curriculum for my major is too biased and far from what I wanna do in the industry. Also I just felt like I am not a good fit here. Yes, it is a fantastic school. But I constantly feel like I don’t belong here. I didn’t feel like it at my previous college. I don’t like the vibe here personally. People are so different from my home state. I just feel like I’m not a good fit for the ucr community and I feel very miserable. I am just very depressed since I got in. Do you think I should transfer again? I just transferred here.. but I don’t see myself studying here for extra 2 years. There are colleges that still accept people for this 2021 fall, but it’s gonna be rolling admission. Also if I don’t apply for 2021 fall, it’s gonna be too late since I’m already 3rd year. Also I barely got in cs major. Y’all know how cs major is so competitive to get in.

Larrabee section of CSE20 for Winter,"**First**, there are no codes to be given out.  The department is not giving anyone codes until January. The only codes that Larrabee can conceive of giving out would only be given out only if the other two sections are full, and the codes would go to engineers (and AGPM) majors first.  That said, get on the waitlist if you want in. The Waitlist will be sorted by major and then the codes will go out in order.

**Second**, the section is full.  The other two sections are less than half full.  I don’t know who “staff” is, but Benedict Paten is an excellent instructor and he and Larrabee will be sharing materials. It is better to be in a section than to not be in a section...

**Third**, If you don’t get into the Larrabee section, she is willing to let you participate in the section via doing the programming and homework on your Zybook (which you would have to buy—like $40) and attending via Zoom, even if you don’t get in (but no non-Zybook quizzes or tests).  This won’t get you a grade, but it will allow your to learn, and then you can take the test to go into CSE30 in the beginning of Summer.

**Last**, emailing Larrabee about this won’t help you!  If you want in, and you think you have a pitch, wait until the first week of class. At that point, if you want a zoom link, that would be reasonable (but probably you can get the link off of Larrabee’s SOE CSE20 web page).",k0gotk,, Academic ,,, Academic , ACADEMIC ,['ACADEMIC'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Incoming grad student looking for housing,"Hi all,

On-campus housing didn't work out for me, so I'd like to get a feel for my options. Does anyone here have a room available? I'm 24 and coming down from the SF bay area to master in accounting, which will be a one-year program. I cook (though my repertoire is not expansive) and clean (shared areas, my room will probably be messy!). I'm pretty easy-going and it would take a lot for me to have a problem with someone.  
  
In my spare time, I used to lift a lot until I injured myself. With that on the shelf, I've gotten back into gaming although I intend to cut back once I'm in school. I never really got into basketball but I find it really fun, and would like to get into it and stay fit.

"As a rejected applicant, I wish people in the UCs would appreciate how important genetic talent is","A lot of people don't feel comfortable talking about genetics and raw talent or say things like ""talent doesn't matter, hard work does"". I don't know why people keep denying that when so many people work their asses off only to not go anywhere near as people in this school for example.

During high school, I have to spent ALL of my time studying in AP courses in order to get good grades. I spent approximately 25 hours per week studying, on top of all the time spent in class. I had ZERO free time for extracurriculars, and I had no free time to socialize. I literally made zero friends in high school because I needed every last second to study. If I didn't have those seconds, I literally ended up bombing quizzes and tests. It was that fragile. 

I tried going to my counselors and teachers early on in high school to talk about my academic struggles and how I am not where I wanted to be, but none of their study techniques helped. I googled all over the Internet to find better study techniques, but none of the helped. No matter how much I tried to improve my time management, I simply could never have figured out in high school. 

And my lack of genetic talent prevented me from doing well in extracurriculars anyway. Like I tried to join my high school's track team, but I got rejected because I was too slow despite working my ass off before tryouts. I couldn't pass auditions for band no matter how much I practiced because I just didn't have the talent. 

It just hurts when so much of life success is determined by things out of your control.

I can just change my major at the end of my freshman year, I believe, so I'm thinking as picking one of those if they're less competitive for my application, then switching to CS at the end of freshman year. ",56kbs2,, Academic ,,, Admissions ," ACADEMIC

Subject to dismissal," Last quarter a bunch of things were going on in my life; my grandfather needed help getting to and from the hospital and other help because of a nasty fall, and I'm the only family that lives near him, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness that I also needed to go to the hospital for about a dozen times during the quarter, and I was dealing with such bad anxiety that I started going to therapy/ doing meds for the first time. My GPA ended up at 1.3 which put me straight on subject to dismissal, but I submitted to late withdraw from the quarter right before finals. I was accepted for a late withdrawal so those grades will get replaced with Ws eventually. This quarter I'm doing a bit better, and I'll probably end up with another failing grade in a class and two Bs, which would put me right at the necessary 2.0 to get off of subject to dismissal. It's possible that one of my Bs will end up at a B- which would be under the required GPA. Would the fact that I am waiting on a withdrawal from my previous classes help with this? If the other quarter is replaced with Ws would I still be on subject to dismissal? I'll still have over a 3.4 overall GPA since I only got As before this and I'm in my senior year. I literally only need 2 more classes next quarter and the class that I'm failing wasn't necessary for me to graduate.",11wsa86,, Academic ;<br> Health ;<br> Social life ,,, Academic ," ACADEMIC

just a rant about having no motivation from a class of 2021 transfer student,"I don't even know if this is an online-school related problem, it probably would have still existed if COVID never happened, but almost a year of online classes isn't helping.

The problem is I have no positive motivators to finish my degree. Basically my only motivator is the fear of what will happen if I DON'T get a degree.

I've come to realize that my major isn't something I'm really interested in. So I can't produce motivation by thinking about a specific future I'm working towards with my degree, because I have no such future in mind. I'm not motivated by the prestige/identity of the school either. I guess I just went here because apparently employers care about the rankings of the school you went to. But tbh if I was an employer I wouldn't want to hire me, I don't have any internship experience and I would rather jump off a cliff than make a LinkedIn profile.

I skipped a whole week of classes just to be able to get my homework assignments in this week and then I just didn't do the assignments (not for lack of time) because I cannot construct a narrative in my head as to why I should be doing them. And now I'll have to spend the weekend catching up on a week's worth of lectures and I won't get a break before the next week of torture begins. I've used up every possible method to try to motivate myself to focus on assignments, for example, I physically cannot listen to music or podcasts anymore because I now associate them with the feeling of forcing myself to do assignments.

I feel that if I were to construct some reason as to why I should be motivated in my current classes it would just be lying to myself. And I don't want to switch majors because a.) I only have two quarters left to finish my current major and b.) what would I even switch it to that I would be more motivated in than my current major? I also don't want to take a quarter off because I really didn't like living at UCLA and I want to finish all my classes while they're still online so I don't have to go back there. I know that I just need to somehow find the motivation to get through the next two quarters, but 5 months is a long time and I don't know how I will do it.

CS head Eli Gafni Talking about 'Chinese Virus',"Hi folks, I was told by my friends in CS department (well, surprisingly none of them Chinese) that their head Eli Gafni publicly talked about 'Chinese virus' and mocked those who tried to suggest that it may be inappropriate as the China communist party's patriotic puppies who pose no threat to his tenure.

&amp;#x200B;

I am honestly shocked when I heard about this story and read the email records. I guess it's been well known (probably even in mainland China) that the China government has been quite shitty about covering things up amidst the early outbreak, but really that has nothing to do with the students who are victims of the whole thing. Eli Gafni's speech was just so disgusting. I don't want to escalate it to the degree of hate speech or what, but how can be be just so ignorant and Trumpy? 

I have filed a report to ASCC as an alumnus in hope that this may get more publicized and an apology can be made to the students involved (though I know that it's unlikely lol). But still, my weird sense of justice (I am a journalist by training and my career hasn't killed all of my sense of justice yet) suggested that I should at least try to publicize this to a wider community. So far I haven't been able to get any comment from the directly involved students or the department. The information providers from the CS department request to remain anonymous since Prof. Gafni has a holy tenure and is heading the department.",fkls9d,, Academic ;<br> Social life ,,,," ACADEMIC

We were in the same GE Cluster (Global Environment!) and have kept in touch since then.  She has always been one to make an impact not only on those close to her but also the world around her.

Janet has gone through one round of cancer - she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2009.  She fought it with grace and determination, was able to beat it, and was in remission until late 2011.  Now, Janet needs to find a bone marrow match by this April.

Here's where you can help.  **Monday, January 23rd, there will be a bone marrow registry drive at Ackerman Grand Ballroom from 6pm-10pm.**  Please please please consider registering.

I’m thinking about starting a journal club for pre-meds on campus...,"Hey all, I’m a senior at UCLA studying Biochemistry. I’m just gonna frankly say that idk if there’s a journal club like this already on campus. Even if there is, we can still make one. I mean it doesn’t even have to be official, just regular meet ups. I got this idea when I was thinking about applying to medical school and my overall science/medical knowledge. I realized that I took all these pre-reqs, major courses, and electives. But most of the time, I was only listening to lectures, writing them down to memorize, and reading the textbooks so I could pass the exams. I never had a chance to talk about the concepts, explain them to someone else, or kept myself up to date with the new discoveries today. But these are the exact skills that I will need when I become a doctor. I’m sure some of you are in the same boat. We all studied about the core concepts like how mitochondria being the energy house of the cell, how cancers start and spread, what happens to the foods we eat, etc. But there are many interesting discoveries out there today related to these concepts coming from published papers. And I feel like if we can keep up with them, we will be really educated. I know we don’t have a lot of time here at UCLA for extracurriculars, but if you’re interested, we can definitely make something out of it.

3 C+'s in my first two quarters here.,"Engineering student here.
I know I should be happy since at least I passed all my classes so far (which I'm REALLY thankful about), but I just don't know what I need to change in order to do better this quarter. I got C's in two of my math classes and in physics, and I just feel like I'm the only one failing and doing poorly because the average in these classes are always so high. I do study; I solve extra problems in the textbook and take notes from the book, too. And another bad thing is that as a freshman engineering student, I didn't join any EE clubs that might have allowed me to work on some hands-on projects. I did join a ministry, that I really poured out, and I really love all the people there, but I feel like I haven't been doing so great as an engineering major. My gpa is barely above a 3.0, and I'm scared that my parents might disown me.",89rutg,, Academic ,,,, ACADEMIC ,['ACADEMIC'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

question about moving out from my current lease,"Hi, guys. I'm currently a second-year student living off campus. Recently, I signed a month-to-month lease with one leaseholder. However, I found another better place and planned to move out by the end of this lease, which is Sept 30.

However, I haven't talked with my leaseholder about it, so she currently thought I will continue this lease to next month or longer. I know CA's law mentioned tenant should let the leaseholder knows when they plan to move out 30 days before. So I'm wondering if that means I still need to pay for the next 30 days' rent so that I can move out? Or I can just go by Sept 30.

Tbh, the rent is kind of expensive. I personally am also looking for someone to replace me starting moving in on Sept 30 in order to save that money.

Weekly commute with zip car?,"A friend told me about Zipcar and suggested I use it as a weekly commute from Los Angeles to Irvine. I plan on going back to LA on weekends....is it worth using Zipcar? I see hourly charge is $8-10, and the commute would be about an hour both ways. So monthly, I would use (in theory) about $70. Considering I wouldn't pay for gas or insurance, that's pretty good. Question is, am I allowed to take the car to LA and leave it there for the weekend, and then would I be able to take it back without reserving it for the entire weekend?

UCI Test Kitchen Recipes #2: Layered Parfait (Brandywine/Breakfast),"The dining halls at UCI try their best to appeal to a lot of different  tastes and appetites with their food choices, but sometimes you want  something more filling or satisfying, but don't want to go to UTC or  another place to get food. UCI Test Kitchen serves to help that problem,  creating new food ideas with ingredients found throughout the dining  hall stations.

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be making a layered parfait, a filling, yet compact way to start the day!

**Ingredients:**

1 sliced banana (in baskets next to the Farm Stand station)

3-4 scoops yogurt (Farm Stand station; flavors depend on day)

1/2 cup granola (found in bowls next to Farm Stand station)

1/2 cup Cheerios or other cereal (Second Breakfast station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1.) Pour 1-2 scoops of yogurt into a glass

2.) Pour some granola, Cheerios, and banana slices on top of the yogurt

3.) Repeat steps 1 and 2 to desired height or ratio

&amp;#x200B;

Get creative with the toppings in the parfait, adding in fruit, brown sugar, and more, then enjoy!

*\*Note:  Some ingredients depend on what options the dining hall puts out for  the day, so some parts of the recipes may not be readily available for  every time of day. Most recipes/locations are based off of Brandywine's stations.*

ucla housing refuses to disinfect rooms of students with confirmed covid infections,"I'm so mad. I'm moving in this week and my roommate tested positive (not mad at her, it happens). Asked my RA when my room will be disinfected so I can come back and the answer is NEVER? What happened to people in hazmat suits coming in and disinfecting things? 

I was told I can request a ""disinfecting kit"" from the front desk and even that's not a given. Gee, thanks, some lysol wipes for my entire room?? For an airborne virus that can also survive on surfaces for up to three days... Ridiculous. 

I don't know who to argue with. I'm so angry. I feel even more like my school doesn't care for my wellbeing. For heaven's sake, I got the vaccine early because of my chronic lung issues.

One of the most redlined and hence poorly funded UCs let in the biggest freshman class among all the UCs and the students are suffering the consequences,"Really horrible look by the Provost today as well with their email. It's near impossible to get classes in your major here. UCR has made some hires, but after accounting for churn (people leaving), it's a drop in the bucket. The reason the average unit load is low is a larger issue which includes significant bottlenecks. The sheer size of the amount of people in non college credit math and english courses adds to that as well. The academic demographics of UCR are changing and the school IS NOT supporting them.

Students are being crammed in some of the most poorly maintained facilities among all the UCs are faculty is being forced into overcrowded classrooms in poorly maintained buildings. These are verifiable claims.

UCR has a shortage of hundreds of workers and lacked a plan for adequate housing. Regardless, as captured in the email by the Provost today, they saw dollar signs. The Provost also stated they want to draw out of state tuition. Yeah, that's contrary to President Drake's vision and conflicts with sole reason UCR was asked to take in more students (to educate more Californians).

If you deferred this year because of the housing crisis, or if you're unable to access the resources you need, or can attest to the crowding of campus, share your thoughts.

"Looking for anteater within my area, help pls ( ຈ ﹏ ຈ )","So my roomate and I have only been in our apartment for a few days now and like just recently ants have been appearing everywhere in our apartment. First it started off as a couple of roamers in the bathroom...but then one day the unthinkable happened...THEY INVADED OUR DONUTS!! Like bro and gals that was our only source of food. So after we threw the donuts away there wern't really any ants left. Of course though, that wasn't the end of it. My roomate bought cookies one day and we left them on the counter, but like these cookies were under maximum security for they were in like a thiccc plastic box. But no it wasn't enough, these ants like made holes in the plastic and got to the cookies! As poor university students, this was a devastating blow to our wallets and our well being...for again, this was one of our only sources of food. This isn't even our apartment anymore, the ants have taken over our kitchen, bathroom, and beds! We are paying rent for these ants at this point :(. So if any of you know where i can find an anteater to come in and lick this place up that would be much appreciated.

To all freshmen living on-campus,"**\*\*\*PLEASE BE PATIENT\*\*\***

I know you've probably heard this countless times as a response to your posts but I feel like we should be more specific in what we mean. Therefore:

* If you haven't received an assignment email, *be patient*. It will make it to you don't worry! The housing office and your RA has been preparing for your arrival since May! If anything, we've waited longer than you have to find out who you are :) Everyone on the housing team is doing their best for you, we just want to put the extra effort to accommodate everyone and that takes time. Is it annoying? Hell yeah. But we'll get to you in no time.
* If you don't have the community you want, *be patient*. Everyone and their moms wanted Mesa Court. We get it! It's beautiful and newer and doesn't have construction. But having a negative mindset before you've even given your community a chance is unfair both to your community and to yourself. Your experience is what you make of it. Mesa can be a pain for a lot of reasons, as can Campus Village, Middle Earth, Arroyo, etc. No community will be 100% perfect on its own. Because it's about the people that you meet and your attitude. Again, be patient, be open, and you are bound to have a wonderful experience.
* If you don't like the room assignment you have, *be patient.* We will get to you eventually, but remember to **please contact your community directly**. (i.e. [mesacourt@uci.edu](mailto:mesacourt@uci.edu)) Your RA literally had nothing to do with your assignment! So we cannot help you lmao pls don't try :')))))
* If you're wondering about your theme, *be patient*. It's meant to be a surprise and it rotates every year depending on your RA/CA. It'll be revealed to you once you receive a welcome letter from us, which will probably be happening within the next week or so. That being said, themes are one out of the hundreds of things your RA plans months in advanced. We're just as anxious as you are to have you find out! :)

Basically we all love you and we've never even met you. The last four to five months have been consumed with the excitement of wanting to meet you and we just want to make your year great. All we ask in return is your patience and open hearts.

​

Cheers,

ur RA (maybe)

​

tl;dr pls don't be the kid in the back seat asking ""are we there yet?"" every five minutes or we will kick u out of the car, k thx bye love u

Question for any computer builders/tech geeks at UCI,"Alright fellow Anteaters, I recently had an old computer completely fail and am considering going through local classifieds/Facebook listings to find a decent, but not too expensive, replacement in the meantime.

Right now, I'm considering buying older, already built gaming PCs that people sell after upgrading (after having terrible luck with regular desktops sold in stores). If anyone can help me look over some listings, or have other options to suggest, send me a message.

Normally, I would go to the computer threads to read up on building one, but I won't have the time to research or build anything for now. An already-built PC is what I'll need to start completing tasks right away.

Dear cola strikers. Where is the money that will pay for your 58% pay increase?,"This is a link to the universities actual assets and liabilities https://foundation.ucsc.edu/endowment/documents/fy19/ucsc-fs-fy18.pdf . This is a link to the size of UCSC’s endowment fund. https://www.google.com/search?q=ucsc+endowment&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS763US763&amp;oq=ucsc+endow&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0j69i60l3.3622j1j4&amp;hl=en-US&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8 . 


As you can see the university itself  only has a fraction of the 22 million dollar price tag of your pay increase (1400 a month* 9 months * 1800 graduate students). UCSC’s endowment fund (215 million) is the second smallest endowment fund next to Merced’s ( 55 million ). If we (generously, as in overestimating) assume the endowment fund pays out 6% interest every year that is about 12,900,000. AND if we assume that the university cuts all funding for the other programs and debt payment. The school still needs an extra million dollars EVERY YEAR just to pay for your COLA. 

The school also has about 1 million in cash and HAD probably around 1,700,000 in liabilities (that is until you all decided to protest and the school spent millions on riot police). 

WHERE DO YOU EXPECT TO GET THE MONEY FROM????? UCSC doesn’t have loads of income coming in like other UCs, we have no sports, no real massive donors unlike the other UCs, and we give out the most academic scholarships of any UC. The university TRIED to build housing, it was blocked by environmental groups and people in town who wanted to keep property values high. What do you people want???? I don’t think any employer has ever given a 58% pay increase in history, and I’m willing to bet uc Santa Cruz could care less about you all (no offense, just the truth). Instead of inconveniencing everyone here who just wants an education, please come up with a PLAN that will actually work before trying to meet with the UC. The argument “lOoK hOw bIg yOuR eNdOwMeNt fUnD iS” is not valid. The university can’t just sell all its assets and investments because then it won’t have money in the future to pay for its programs and debts.",f3jsoy, Unclassified , Financial ;<br> Social life , Financial ,, Financial ," FINANCIAL

I always feel like the stupidest one in my stem classes.,"I decided to become a south campus major after I realized how bored I was in my north campus classes even though I am gifted at writing and reading, and because I usually preferred to study for my south campus classes instead because the material was always more interesting for me. 

But it doesn’t matter how many hours and hours I study, I always fall behind the class because when new material comes I’m still too busy trying to understand the previous week’s material and with some classes I don’t comprehend the material so much that I feel like i can’t go to office hours because I don’t even know WHAT to ask. I know it’s because I’m not studying right - I never seem to have enough time to do actual practice problems, because I waste too much time learning the theory of things first which is necessary to do practice problems (right?). 

Then shit is hitting the fan now that midterms are here. I hate overhearing conversations of “oh yeah that was awful” from people I KNOW know what they’re doing in the class when I’m over here having left pages blank. 

I just hate always being so behind even though I love the material. It’s almost self-sabotage choosing to do something I’m not “gifted” at because I like doing it, but I can’t go back to acing everything but hating life. I feel like I should have gone to my local UC or Cal State to be a stem major instead because based on the stem classes I’ve taken there over the summer I actually felt capable and on top of the game.

There isn’t really a rhyme or reason to this post. Maybe just to get advice on studying, maybe to hear if there are actually other people out there who struggle in their classes. I just always feel like I’m the only one at this damn school.

Edit: I really appreciate all the replies (and upvotes); it’s nice to know people out there took the time to read my messy disorganized post-midterm crisis. My eyes are a lil swollen from stress crying earlier but reading everything has made me feel a lot better since then. Onward and upward.

UCSC CS:GO Team Recruiting,"Hello everyone, 

Last year, UCSC's CSGO team had one of the best collegiate CSGO teams. We qualified for a LAN event in Santa Ana at the eSports Arena, called the Collegiate Colloseum, where we played onstage and placed 4th among the best collegiate teams in the west. Not only that, UCSC's CSGO team placed in the top 16 of about 80 total colleges in the Collegiate Star League, a league made exclusively for college students to compete for scholarship money. 

Last CSL season's prize pool was $5,000 in scholarship money, but this coming season, the CSGO prizepool is tenfold that, sitting at $50,000 in total. Our playoff journey was cut short as we lost to one of the grand finalists, but we're looking to change that this year. With some players leaving and some graduating, the team roster is looking to be filled with some new talent. It is uncertain if we will be participating in other leagues besides the Collegiate Star League, but there are plenty of different leagues we are looking to compete in if we can find the players.

Want to play fighting games like Street Fighter, Smash, and others? Check out the the Santa Cruz Fighting Game Community (SCFGC)! We're a local organization that supports fighting game players from all different games.

Any fighting game player of any background or skill level will find something to enjoy at our events. For players looking for some competition, we host weekly tournaments where participants put themselves head-to-head with Santa Cruz’s finest. For our players looking for more casual play, we also host weekly casual meet-ups where people just chill, play games, and watch streams.

If you’re new to fighting games, don’t hesitate to show up to events! We always have plenty of other new players joining the community to play with, and veterans will be more than happy to teach you how to play and give you some experience.

**WHICH FIGHTING GAMES ARE PLAYED?**

Ultra Street Fighter IV, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Project M are by far the most popular games, but we have many who play others like Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Mortal Kombat X, Skullgirls, King of Fighters XIII, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late, and more.

We're always looking to support more games, and our players are always willing to try new ones! We even host highlight events where we encourage players to try new games.

**WHERE DO PEOPLE PLAY?**

People either meet at spontaneous meet-ups which usually start as a Facebook post that go something like, “Anyone wanna play today?” or through the various events we host.

Meet-ups can vary depending on where everyone can meet up. Usually locations end up being at a library, campus dorm/apartment, or off-campus house. Official events are generally hosted somewhere on-campus.

At the moment we haven’t finalized our event schedule and venues quite yet, but we expect to have a tournament every Friday and casual meet-up every Saturday at the Jack Basin Engineering area of campus.

We’ll update our social media when the event schedule and location have finalized.

**HOW DO I GET INVOLVED?**

Our [Facebook group](http://facebook.com/groups/santacruzfgc) is our most popular channel for staying up-to-date with community activities and directly talking with local players. We also have a [Twitter](http://twitter.com/santacruzfgc) too where we’ll tweet event happenings and stream schedules.

If you don’t use social media, our [website](http://santacruzfgc.com) also has our event schedule, FAQ, and tournament rules.

If you can’t make it to an event, you can still watch live through our [Twitch livestream](http://twitch.tv/santacruzfgc) or watch our match recordings at our [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/santacruzfgc).

I'm a first-year student and I stayed home for Fall Quarter. My parents and friends convinced me to stay home and I know they were just trying to protect me from COVID and all, which I understood. But I honestly had a miserable time these past few months (which I'm assuming some of you can relate to). For reasons related to domestic abuse, I really want to move into UCI for these next two quarters and get away from my home.  

The only thing stopping me though is, again, my parents. My parents are fine with me moving down, but they want me to move in a month later than my move-in date and they are firm on this. But I TRULY cannot stand living at home for another month. I guess my question is, what can I do now? How can I get out of this situation? And also, am I just overreacting? Should I just suck it up and fight through that one month even though I know it'll hurt me? Someone please help and thank you so much for reading this.",kh3y0y, Housing ;<br> Health , Housing ;<br> Health , Health , Housing , Housing ;<br> Health ," HOUSING

Is housing actually as difficult to get as everyone makes it out to be?,"I have seen multiple articles about how difficult it is for students at UCSC to find housing. But a common factor seems to be that these students were ones who missed the initial housing application deadline/submitted it late. Usually because its too expensive to live on campus. Or they want to live off campus, but then cant find anything.

I visited Santa Cruz last week and I can understand to an extent why there is difficulty regarding housing, but I'm not a student there and usually you guys have way better insight cause you've been through the process.

Is it actually this bad? Or is it easy to get on campus housing, as long as you are willing to pay, and get your app in before the deadline.",sekv7e, Housing , Housing , Housing , Housing , Housing , HOUSING ,['HOUSING'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

So I don’t have WiFi anymore,"I kept getting messages from ResNet saying I was out of compliance because I didn’t have anti-virus software. I use Mac OS and I’ve never had a virus ever since switching to Mac (about 8 years now). Even as a 12 year old idiot downloading sketchy files for Minecraft via Mediafire with pop-ups appearing every 10 seconds, I was always okay. So I just ignored the messages because I didn’t want anti-virus software. 

Now they’ve suspended my internet access. Okay, fine. You win. I tried to game the system but it didn’t work. I’ll get your stupid anti-virus protection. So I try to click on the links to free software suggested. 

Here’s the real kicker: now that I no longer have internet I can’t actually access those links. Whenever I click one, Google Chrome stops me because the link is apparently unprotected. I imagine that’s either the fault of the internet suspension or ResNet not giving me good links in the first place. So now I’m kind of stuck in this loop where I don’t have internet because my computer doesn’t comply, but I can’t fix the compliance issues because I don’t have internet. 

It’s not the end of the world just yet. I have a couple ideas as to obtaining this software in other methods, and I’ll contact ResNet if none of them work. But I guess lesson of the day: don’t do what I did?? Also ResNet idk if you’ll see this but maybe please consider universal access to anti-virus websites regardless of compliance? Wish me luck (low-key expecting these programs to just not work on Mac OS)

tl;dr suspended from internet because computer doesn’t comply, but in order to fix the compliance issues I need internet access",e0m7tt, Unclassified , Social life , Housing , Social life , Housing ," SOCIAL LIFE

Advice about financial aid,"Hey all, incoming freshman here. I'm currently out of the country right now, but before I left the states about a week ago the office requested a ""Students Assets Form"" from me. I didn't have access to a fax machine at the time so I printed out the forms, filled it out, and took pictures of it and emailed it to the office. I explained in the email why I had to send the forms this way and told them I would not be able to provide any more information or have access to my email since I would be out of the country. So yeah. I can still check my UCI portal and see that they still haven't received my forms. Gmail is blocked so I don't know if they responded to my email. What can I do?

89 in Mathematics,"I graduated 1989 in mathematics. I was recently looking around the website and noticed how much it changed. You guys have way more classes to pick from than we did. I would have taken mathematical logic if they had it back then.

Back then it was like a time warp back to the sixties. I remember a guy coming up to me telling me about Ram Dass and ending with telling me that I would not even have to quit drugs. On another occasion I had a very early class. As I approached the classroom I wanted to know how late I was and so I asked a guy. He just stared at his watch, which is where I left him after several minutes. 

My roommate freshman year had an enormous crush on Modonna (a star from the 80’s). He had a butcher paper poster with every postage stamp sized picture of her. 

There was a huge muscular guy with a feminine style and voice two doors down. He was a very gifted writer. I have no doubt he is writing for Hollywood movies now. I was a pretty normal guy with a couple of men’s magazines in my desk. When he learned this, He was concerned about me (you heard that right) so he invited me to go on a walk and talk one night, which we did. He made a very emotional plea to me to dispose of them but I held strong to my views on consenting adults. We left it with agreeing to disagree.

I remember seeing deer now and then and one time an enormous snake by the library. This couple were just standing there staring. I thought they were more of the mushroom crowd and so I passed them. Then I saw it. Maybe 8 feet long.

One thanksgiving I decided to stay. What I didn’t think about was that the cafeteria was closed. So I decided to go downtown for dinner. Well the bus was not running either, so I walked. When I got there I found pretty much everything was closed. I finally found a 7/11 that was open. I bought some jerky, candy and a can of cranberry. Well when I got back I realized that I did not have a can opener, so I found a rock and pounded the can. I finally got in.

Well I just wanted to touch base.",ouzelj, Unclassified , Social life , Academic , Social life ,," SOCIAL LIFE

Like someone was venting about their psych classes how she couldn’t get into them and then some asshole shat all over her and her choice (she wants to be a psychologist) and said get a real job and do it on the side. Same thing happened to me, I’m a film major and oof the trade school bois really wanted to go off. The audacity of some of these assholes, I don’t see anyone shitting on your plumber or electrician job.

How can I level up my life?,"Ok, this is gonna be a full dump of my life. I will be very specific about my goals/dreams while not exposing my identity. I organized different topics into paragraphs, and I hope that will make it easier for you guys to read. I sincerely apologize if this is super tempting to read, but I am lost in my life, and it took the best effort to craft this mini-essay. Feel free to ask for clarification. Here they are.

I immigrated to the US when I was in 7th grade, and I graduate from one of the high schools in Irvine. I first attend a UC school for my fresh and sophomore year, and then I came back to Irvine because I was admitted to UCI; I am going to be a film and media studies major here at UCI, and I hope I can continue to pursue an upper/higher education. Attending UC Irvine had always been my ambitious dream and an “above average” choice for my parents: I am very excited that I can continue my education here. Although other institutes can offer me a more comprehensive education in film production, I figured UCI is the best choice that I can make right now (FAFSA, tuition, people’s vibe, easy commute, etc). I want to get the most from the 2 years that I will be studying at UCI.

It is already the end of July, and I was just recovering from school stress by keeping up routines such as working out, sleeping early, and more. I work part-time in a fast food restaurant, and I just started to save my earnings now because I have no big bills to pay (no rent cause I am living with my mom); however, I spend part of my earnings to help cover my family expenses. For the most part, I can use my earnings to buy things that I want such as clothes, camera gear, groceries, etc. So I am not relying heavily on my parents, financially speaking of course. I have high interest in photography and filmmaking, which leads me to find my passion. I also like to draw, but the last time I dedicatedly spend time drawing regularly was like 2 years ago (yep, school got me real hard). 

My ultimate career goal is to work in a big film company or a movie industry. But I want to first become a high school art teacher before pursuing that big dream because I get time to explore what specific film job/role I wanna take (and get good at it of course). I am also afraid that working in a visual art industry can be tempting and kill all the creativity, but I want to see where my potential is at. Anyway, I know UCI has a master + teacher credential program for graduate students, but I am not 100% sure if I will for sure go to UCI for my master degree. 

Speaking of some long-term goals, I know this sounds super immature but I wonder when is the best time to find my life partner. I never dated girls before and am neither afraid to approach them. I have some male friends, and enough girlfriends to interact with. All my friends believe that I am a decent, sincere, and humorous dude but never have luck. Well, I guess it can also be because I am holding back. Many of my friends, who date or date girlfriends, suggest I live in YOLO but I don’t think that is a good choice. Especially with school, work, hobbies, and many countless things going on, I don’t know if it is good to invest time in an unstable relationship. But I also agreed that there will never be a “stable” period in my life because everything changes. I recently downloaded bumble and hinge just to meet new people outside of my comfort zone, but I learned social media and the apps are toxic because they mistakenly shape people so “unreal.” I did read the book “how to not die alone” and figured the book taught me good stuff, but I never find a chance to apply those because those tricks really can only be used on adults who are not at school. 

Maybe finding a reliable life partner at the age of 20 can be a little bit too much, but I do want to make some good friends. Like those friends who are willing to push each other up to become the best version of themselves. In my past 2 years of UC college experience, not gonna lie but almost all the people there are toxic and lazy. I cannot really blame them because COVID still exists lol. I attempted to change my social groups and explore new people, but all those excess “socializing” brings real fatigue to me. I became really tired of those so I essentially “solo” everything. Don’t get me wrong I still meet friends there; in fact, they are all really awesome, but we never get a chance to understand others because school can be time-consuming. Plus I don’t have a car so I am not sure if I can just drive anywhere easily.

I really want to be successful and make my friends/family proud of me, and I am willing to put myself out there sweating/digging if needed. But right now I am very lost on where to even start. I guess this can be part of growing up because there is no more “user instruction” or “a step-to-step manual” for me to read. Time progresses and I feel like I am losing my purpose to even exist (ok that might be too much but you know what I mean right). I am fortunate that I can be semi-financial independent, but should I really go beat myself up in my fast food restaurant to beat myself up? Dating a girl for a short-term relationship can be cool, but I don’t want to risk both of our great possibilities to be stuck into something that will eventually go away.",wd9vke, Unclassified , Social life , Social life , Social life ,," SOCIAL LIFE

ICS is sucking my life away..,"Yo.

I am an undeclared freshman here who is trying to get into the ICS school to switch into a computer science major or possibly CSE

I am currently in ICS 32, and our next project is due on May 1st; it was assigned this passed Tuesday.

I have no other homework since I'm taking all GE's and ICS 32, and the GE's are pretty free at the moment.

So you're probably thinking; I have until May 1st to do this project, AND I have no other homework!? I should be partying, going out with friends, working, and/or enjoying life!!

But instead, I started the project on Wednesday and have been working, pretty much non stop ever since (only stops I've made is to eat, go to class, sleep)

For some reason, whenever I get a project assigned (or ICS assignment in general) I always feel the need to do it *immediately* and finish it ASAP. This is because back in ICS 31, I waited until the last day for one of the assignments and it was a very stressful experience to get the code working.

So now I start programs right when they're released, even though I have 2 weeks to finish them.

You might be thinking that this is a great habit. But get this:

I actually finished it the project yesterday. I got it to run and do everything the instructions asked for (I'm pretty sure I checked like 50 times to make sure) and yet I just keep getting this *anxious* feeling like I did something wrong. So I keep running the program over and over, testing out all possible situations. Sometimes, I find an error and I fix it, and this causes me to run it again 1000 times to see if there's another error. Rinse and repeat.

I also have this *need* to make my code look the cleanest way possible, so I constantly change variable names, add functions, alter functions, make sure my return types, doc strings, type annotations all make sense, etc, even though the execution of the program is still the same in the end and my original design was already good enough.

Basically, I never feel satisfied with my code. I always have this *feeling* like I need to work on it, even though it's currently saturday morning, 2:49 AM and the code executes exactly as it did on Thursday night.

And guess what? I won't be satisfied until the deadline, may 1st when I have no choice but to stop working on it. Until then, I won't be surprised if I constantly come back to this project and continuously run it.

This is what I did for the previous project as well. I finished it a week before it was due, and I kept finding little tiny errors that probably don't matter at all (since my Lab TA's sometimes can't even find a resolution to my errors) which always gave me this *anxious* feeling.

Basically, ICS is sucking my life away. Whenever a project is assigned, all I think about is the project. Maybe I just enjoy it so much that I want to be absolutely perfect, but I also want to be able to do other things in my life. I'm over here sleeping at 3:00 AM cuz I'm just so addicted to this project.

Damn. Anyone else get this feeling when doing ICS projects? Like you're never satisfied and you just keep seeking perfection, only for that perfection to never happen?

Hey /r/UCLA! My friend and decided against interning this summer and built a website for students instead. It came out half-way decent and we wanted to share with you.,"My name is Eric, I go to the University of North Florida. This summer another student and I created a reddit-like website that is on its way to being a phenomenal student resource (currently at 1100ish student users).

The URL is [http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) and it is a student-to-student networking site for sharing resources and getting study help from students all over who share your major and courses. There is also a news feed for each campus.

We have created a [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgqCTrnb2Oo) for you to see what the website is all about before registering.

All you need to sign up is a .edu email address. As an avid user of the world wide web I know that this is a lot to ask so if you feel uncomfortable about giving that information away and still wanted to try out the site I will create you an account if you pm me or you can send me an email at enopanen@openleaf.me

Hopefully those of you that try out the site will find it to be a good source of information at some point. We built the site with the theme of open-data and open-information in mind and promise not to do anything sketchy with your personal information.

TL:DR [http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) is an awesome student resource website that we built this summer and we won't sell your email address if you sign up.

Is it possible to do a part-time internship in Hollywood?,"Hi all,

I'm going to be a senior soon. I recently had a phone interview with a company in Hollywood, and now they want to do an in-person interview as well. It got me thinking, would I even be able to go to school and do this internship if I got it? It's paid, and they're asking for 20-25 hours a week. Has anyone been in a similar situation where they had to commute from Irvine to Hollywood for a part-time job or internship, and is it doable? Also, this would be my first internship. I don't want to pass out from health problems because of this lol. I'm open to any suggestions :)

"If I fell in a dorm shower and died, how long would it take for them to find me?","Hey. So I had this thought at like, 4 a.m. when I was taking a shower this morning. 

If I slipped and fell while taking a shower in a dorm causing me to die, HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE AUTHORITIES TO FIND ME?

Think of it. I've noticed every time that I take a shower when housing staff cleans the bathroom, they never open the stall/bother with it (obviously). Even if they did notice ""hey, every time I come in and clean the bathroom someone is using the shower"" they can't really do anything because it could be a different person every time they clean the shower and it just *happened* to be during the time to clean showers. 

Also, if my roommates haven't seen me for a while and became concerned, they could ask the locked stall if I was in there. But if I didn't answer, they'd just assume it's not me. 

Would it be until I started smelling like decomp? And in that case: if I was just in a catatonic state but still alive, would I just starve there? Let's say I started smelling really bad because of the stages of decomp. Would it just wash away because I am in the shower? If someone noticed the smell, would they just assume ""eeww, someone had a nasty shit"" and continue on their day?

So I'm just wondering how long it would take for them to discover that I was in the shower. Thoughts?",f9w6ui,, Health ;<br> Social life , Unclassified , Social life , Housing ," SOCIAL LIFE

I’m going back for grad school after a gap year and out of no where I get a letter in the mail saying I owe \~$9,000 (keep in mind this quarter’s tuition isn’t due until 9/20). They put a hold on my account and I couldn’t enroll in classes. I went to financial aid office and they had no idea what was going on either. They called some other office and whoever was on the other end of the line was clearly not willing to explore the possibility that it was a system error. They talked for 15 minutes and couldn't figure out where this outstanding balance is coming from. They postponed the hold on my account until the end of the month and said they would “investigate” and get back to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m kind of freaking out because I KNOW I paid for everything when I was an undergrad. I got scholarships, took out loans, and did the bruin payment plan to pay for everything. I also was able to graduate and get my diploma, which you aren’t allowed to do if you have outstanding payments. Also I got a letter last month about the outstanding balance (and I graduated over a year ago!), I would think if I owed money while I was an actual student I would have gotten a notification of some kind like a year ago! 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this points to some sort of error on their part but I’m low key so afraid because I feel like they’re going to try and find a way to justify this and make me pay it. I have so much panic about this and I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has ever caught an error on their account and actually had it fixed? Just looking for reassurance tbh bc I am not going to have peace of mind until they tell me I don’t actually owe $9,000. :((((( 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: have you ever had an outstanding balance on bruin bill be INCORRECT then get fixed???",xcuam5,, Financial , Financial , Financial , Financial , FINANCIAL ,['FINANCIAL'],0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
UCLA Men's Basketball Defeats UCB 76-56,"Chris Smith apparently heard the folks saying he wasn’t living up to his potential, scoring 21 points. The Tyger to Jalen connection was on fire, leading to Tyger getting a double-double. We are starting to look like a team where every game a pair of players goes off, with a sense of consistency coming from Tyger. Only downside was iffy free-throw shooting.

wholesome wednesdays: field report,"As I walked into my favorite UCLA class today, I sat down next to my good friend Ben. I'm not really close to Ben, but he seems like a good guy. I've seen him around in a few classes but I never really got to know him.

""Hey Ben"" I said to Ben. 

""Hey 420spook420,"" Ben said to me.

Ben looked at me and smiled. I felt the warmth of his smile. His smile was something else. I could've sworn every time Ben smiles a child is born in the world, somewhere.

""Ben, I want to kiss you,"" I said to Ben.

Before all of you start complaining that this is some sort of erotica, this is NOT. I've written erotica regarding numerous figures here at UCLA and rest assured, this is not the path that I will go down today. First of all, erotica doesn't start off with something as soft as just a kiss I guarantee you that. I'm not sure what you do with your ""bros"" or with your ""homies"" but this is literally what I do with my friends. I wanted Ben to be my friend and this is 420spook420's fool-proof method to make friends. Take notes, fellow Bruins.

""Haha, what?"" Ben said to me. 

""I said I want to kiss you Ben,"" I said to Ben.

Ben glared at me. He had a half smile not sure about what to make of the situation. He hardly knew me, for christ's sake.
But in that moment, everything felt so right. Ben looked like a million dollars, and while I felt nothing but pure friendship between me and Ben, I really wanted to kiss Ben.

""But 420spook420, what will you do when your other friends find out?"" Ben said to me. 

I looked at my hands and started sobbing. I sobbed uncontrollably, and I am a really ugly crier. 

""You are a really ugly crier,"" Ben said to me.

I couldn't take it anymore. I cried harder and harder, putting my feet up to the chair and rested my face into my knees. I shook uncontrollably. 

But in a moment, I felt a hand touch my face. It was a warm hand, full of creases and bumps that just felt so right. It was Ben's hand. 

He grabbed me by the cheek and he kissed me.

Not sure if it was my last post, but fellow bruins, we are coming together as a more wholesome community.",8gkhcs,, Social life , Social life , Social life , Academic ," SOCIAL LIFE

Hey Anteaters!! Blow off some of that new quarter stress and take my Spin Class at the ARC!,"If you have a Group-X or All Access ARC pass, come take my spin-class Tues/Thurs @ 5 PM!

Blow off some of the stress of the new quarter (I know the quarter system hits the ground running).

Shake off some of that move-in anxiety and find a tribe you like to exercise with (Exercising solo can be unmotivating at times).

I'm leaving a link down below on the benefits of cycling, it's really a good workout and does wonders for your confidence/mental health and obviously your physical health!

UCI SPOP Question,"Hi,

So I registered for the SPOP and added 3 guests (via campus groups). I have a question – how does the overnight accommodation work? Is it just for me, the student, or is it also for my family members?

Also, if it is just for me, do they provide the housing on-campus (at the dorms)? If it is for my whole family will it still be on-campus?

I plan to come there before the  orientation starts and they say if you need lodging before or after then you'll have to make your own arrangements (i.e. hotel). So am I going to stay at the hotel or on-campus?

I apologize if I asked a lot of questions but yea I'm curious lol. Would appreciate if someone shared their experience with this. Thanks!",v46mnx,, Academic , Social life , Housing , Academic ," ACADEMIC

Weird Guy Filming Me and Other Passengers On OCTA Bus,"I just had a really uncomfortable experience riding an OCTA bus (167) around 6:30 today (10/25) that left from UCI. I believe a young Asian man wearing a blue hoodie was filming me on the bus. At first I thought he was maybe just playing a video game or watching something and I was being paranoid, but then he moved his camera towards the window for a couple seconds and I could see he was recording on his iPhone’s camera (I could see the red timer on his screen which means recording in progress). He put his phone down when I noticed what he was doing but like a minute later he went back to recording me and a couple of other passengers at the front of the bus for the remainder of my bus ride (~10 min) and I assume he continued after I left. I kept trying to stare him down but eventually he just started staring me in the eye and gave me a creepy/menacing look. He kinda hid his face behind his phone and all I could really see now were his eyes. I told the bus driver before I got off at my stop about how he was acting suspicious/weird since he was filming me and other passengers but she said there was nothing she could do. The few people at the front of the bus were either talking to someone beside them or looking down at their phones so I think I was the only one who noticed him filming. Idk I just felt like people should know about this and be more aware of their surroundings. I have no idea what he intends to do with that footage and I was just really weirded out by the look in his eyes as if he got pleasure out of knowing he was making me uncomfortable while recording me.

Looking for roommates! ,"Hey Reddit, 

My girlfriend and I are looking for some roommate(s) to apartment hunt with. We have a few places in mind, and are mainly sticking with the Brentwood area. We want a 2 bed/2 bath so we need people to fill the other room. If you already have a place with an extra room, we would love to get in on that as well! Our price range goes up to $700 each. At this point, we are up for anything, as our lease ends June 30th. Here's a little about us:

Julie: 22 yrs old, works in Brentwood in a mobile game company, loves Reddit, tumblring, twitter, video games, memes, kittens. 

Alana: 22 yrs old, taking a year off before going to grad school in Michigan, enjoys cooking, food, cute animals, turtles. 

Here's what you should be:
- LGBT friendly (SUPER important)
- Okay with turtles (don't worry, he doesn't bite. he's about the size of a deck of card)
- Clean! (have had too many issues with roommates who leave dishes in the sink for weeks... and also never keep the common areas clean...)
- Pays rent on time
- Nonsmokers 
- Friendly and down for the occasional dinner party, kickback, movie night, and pillow fights

We aren't looking for a new best friend (unless you want to be our besties 4 lyfe) but we would prefer someone who we can chat with and not have awkward silences around. So if you fit all of these, feel free to message me back! ",hmmze,, Housing , Housing , Housing , Housing , HOUSING ,['HOUSING'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Notice of Mandatory Housing Relocation Email,"IMPORTANT: If you did not receive this email, you shouldn't have to worry about being moved.

On to the email:

Dear [Your Name],
In response to COVID-19, UC Santa Cruz has taken steps to dramatically and immediately reduce the number of people living on campus. Students who can return to a permanent address or make alternate housing arrangements have been encouraged to leave campus. However, we understand that leaving campus may not be an option for everyone and we are committed to supporting our students through this outbreak.
In order to focus our staffing and support services on the needs of a smaller residential population on campus, we will be relocating the following residents:

Students living in residence halls

Students living at the Camper Park, Village, or University Town Center

Students living in apartments at Cowell College, Redwood Grove, and the Porter Apartment Buildings F and G

Students will be relocated to College Nine, College Ten, Crown College, or Merrill College. It is our goal to:

Reassign apartment residents to the apartments at one of the above communities.

Reassign residence hall residents to the residence hall facilities at one of the above communities. These housing areas are in proximity to one of the two campus dining halls that we currently plan to keep open (College Nine/College Ten Dining Hall and Crown Dining Hall).

Moving assistance will be provided. This will include moving bins, supplies such as cardboard boxes and tape, as well as movers and trucks to transport your belongings to your new housing assignment.

Housing staff are currently working on your new housing assignment. You will soon receive a message with information about your new room assignment and instructions for completing your move. To be clear, this move is mandatory and we appreciate your cooperation. Note: special attention is being placed on students with disability-related needs to ensure the new housing assignment will meet their individual needs.
In order to maximize efficient use of housing space, while also implementing appropriate physical distancing for residents, each room will be assigned as a single. Students will not be negatively financially impacted by this change to single occupancy residency. Instead all residential students will be charged the triple room rate for spring quarter. Additionally, students on the 5-day meal plan for spring quarter will be upgraded, at no additional cost, to the 7-day plan to ensure dining access during the weekends. Students already on the 7-day plan for spring quarter will receive a rate reduction to the cost of the 5-day plan. Apartment residents who wish to obtain the 7-day meal plan at the 5-day plan cost may do so.
You are receiving this letter because you have indicated that you plan to remain in residence this spring. We want you to know the latest information so that you can make an informed decision about your housing situation to the extent that you have choices. If you can make alternate housing arrangements, we strongly urge you to do so. If you do plan to leave campus, please complete the Intent to Vacate form to indicate your intention to move-out of university housing as soon as possible. We will continue to offer a full housing refund for spring quarter to students who give their intent to vacate and complete their move-out by April 19.
Based upon the current public health information available, the following details the conditions we anticipate in our residential buildings during spring quarter. Please keep in mind that this is an evolving situation and circumstances may change further.

We are doing all we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, the virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were more widely available, it would reveal that many of us, including UCSC students and employees, have already been exposed to this virus.

The primary public health strategy is mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with physical distancing recommendations, cessation of group gatherings, regular handwashing and extra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals. However, we want to prepare you for the reality that some people residing in as well as staff supporting campus housing will inevitably become ill with COVID-19.

It is also inevitable that students who become sick with COVID-19 but are not ill enough to require hospitalization will need to self-isolate in campus residences. Students who are exposed to the virus before they realize it will be living in some proximity to students who are well, increasing the potential for the virus to spread.

We will close several of the residential buildings and relocate any students residing there, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve physical distancing.

Any resident who remains on campus for spring should be prepared to be relocated (possibly more than once) so that we may create spaces for isolation as well as quarantine.

Dining Services will be limited to take-out only meals.

We appreciate that this information may add to your anxiety during what is an already stressful time. It is our goal to share as much information as we have as quickly as possible so you can make decisions that are right for you.
Since you are planning to remain in residence during spring, please begin to prepare yourself for relocation, and follow instructions that will follow from your Housing/Student Life Office.

Sincerely,
Student Housing Services",frxhs4, Housing ;<br> Health , Housing ;<br> Health , Housing ;<br> Health , Housing , Housing ;<br> Health ," HOUSING

AR Parking After 5pm,"Hi y'all!! I'm asking this community since UCI Transportation isn't picking up any of my calls today... 

I know I can park in AR spots after 5pm, but it cannot be in lots that are marked with ""Enforced 24 hours"". Is this statement on the red AR signs that are hanged throughout lots 16 and 12A, or are they listed on the entrance signs to the lots? In other words, can I park in 16 and 12A after 5pm with a commuter permit? 

Also, I know we can park in other zones in unmarked stalls after 3pm, but can we park in other zone's AR spots after 5pm? Or does AR parking only apply to the zone we purchased the permit for? 

Thank you in advance!! ",9l54l6, Transportation , Transportation , Transportation , Transportation , Transportation , TRANSPORTATION ,['TRANSPORTATION'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

As a recent graduate, I quickly realized it was the worst possible time to make a request.  So, I’m trying my luck again and asking if anyone would be willing to share or take an image of people using the Quarry outside of a concert or graduation ceremony (ie study group, hanging out, etc). The image is for a report for the National Park Service about the successful renovation of outdoor amphitheaters and how they maintain their connection to the landscape. We’re writing about how the Quarry does an amazing job of feeling like it’s own special place and not just an empty theater on non-event days. Reply here or dm me if you have any questions.

Please offer some advise,Im worried they are going to find out who I am by writing this but I need to talk to someone .Yeah we did a lot. There there was an moment in which everything blew out proportional one roommates had a hangover and I forgot to take out the trash. Mind you this hangover (puking) occurred at night I got home early so I could have taken out the trash but I forgot and I should have taken out the trash. I spent the day that day helping my roommate out. The next day my roommate the one I share a room with talks to me about the trash and explains that they had a very bad weekend and they don’t want to have to come and take out the trash. They explained they felt they were having to always clean everything. I understand and told them I forgot and apologized. So I felt to my desk and sat down. No yelling or anything but I felt so much anger that I froze when I took a moment to sit down. (Yes byknow I am very much aware of how forgetful and dumb I am) . I think was panking because ai could feel myself shaking. So I left to take this somewhere else. Im trying to get rid of the shakes. And I receive text from my roomate fuming. I explain that I am very stressed right and very sorry. They ask why didn’t you take the trash out. The situation after this led to just more microaggressions until he created a cleaning schedule. ans yes I do follow the schedule I clean.

I have created a new subreddit r/UniversityofCali for all UC students in all campuses. Often times, people would like to talk to members of all others UC's and discuss about certain topics. There was no way in easily doing so, which influenced me to make this subreddit. I spent quite some time creating this subreddit (my first time) and I'm almost done setting up everything.  I politely ask that you up-vote this thread so many students will be able to hear about r/UniversityofCali and become a part of this group.

a little rant,"hello! i hope you are all doing well during this weird time. i just wanted to express my thoughts a little bit on this thread because lately i have been feeling like i was the only person getting frustrated with everyone going out to small gatherings and whatnot. i’ve seen so many of my peers going out, mixing households, untested (presumably, because they dont live on campus), no masks, nothing! it makes me sad that my instagram and snapchat consist of this very thing- people i thought knew better, going out without taking the proper precautions. the recent covid update from uci indicated that the spike in cases this week was due to multiple small-gatherings, and im so incredibly frustrated. 

i understand that quarantine is very isolating, and often times i feel like its not gonna end. sometimes i feel like there is no hope. i agree that hopelessness and loneliness can be mediated by in-person socialization, and i encourage that! but proper social-distancing, mask usage, and maximizing time outdoors (instead of indoors) should also be used. 

im just so confused as to why people think its acceptable to have get-togethers with &gt;5 (even 10???) people from *different* households. hang out with your quarantine bubble! your roomates/housemates! that makes sense! but having small get-togethers with people from multiple households? that *doesn’t* make sense. we have free covid-testing, but thats *only for students that live on on-campus housing*. hanging out with people that live in newport etc. is still risky because they are most likely not being tested. that’s why it is important to take the right precautions :(

i recently moved in to an apartment with random housemates, one of which just rushed a sorority. i’ve seen several several *several* posts on her social media of her hanging out with groups of girls from her sorority. on some occasions, i’ll come back to my apartment from work and be surprised by her sorority sisters hanging out in my apt and i wonder 1. why did my housemate ever think it was okay to invite other ppl (who lives whoknowswhere??) to my apt, and 2. why did the ppl she invite think it was okay in the first place? why do these people think that these actions are okay? and why are there *so many* people that think this is okay?

my housemate posts about going to socials, and has pictures of get-togethers with her sisters. no social distancing, no masks, and sometimes indoors. the thing that bothers me the most is that it is a mixture of households- there are so many people from different apartments, homes etc. that are all gathered together! although on-campus residents are regularly covid-tested, that does not permit  gathering with people that live off-campus (and presumably untested) to be any safer. it’s so hard for me to understand how people think this is okay? let alone post publicly about it? im really disappointed with the greek community, and although i recognize that maybe not all greeks are like this, im still upset nonetheles by how reckless many of them are acting (my housemate is not the only greek i have seen on socials that has been acting like this)

these are the types of social gatherings that create covid clusters. when the consequences of these mistakes (i.e not taking precautions) aren’t recognized, the risk of contracting covid keeps growing exponentially higher. one of the reasons we are still in this pandemic (besides politics of course lol) is because so many people are choosing not to acknowledge the severity of covid.

ignorance is bliss, but if you are 20-something and in college, i think that mindset becomes a choice. you are educated. you have the capacity to learn. you have the capacity to educate and learn about the current situation our world is in. choosing not to acknowledge the covid guidelines because they are inconvenient to you is *incredibly* privileged (but should i be surprised bc i go to school in orange county? idk). what makes me sad is that i thought we would all be better than this- i have seen so many of my own friends not take quarantine seriously, and when i do call them out, it is not constructive. sometimes i feel like i’m going crazy because it feels like nobody else around me cares about covid, but i hope there are some people on this thread that are able to resonate with me. 

bottom line…. please be diligent. hang out with people in your quarantine bubble. if you want to hang out with others, please get tested if you are able to.  please social distance. please wear masks. please hang out outdoors.

sending warm internet hugs to you all. take care, and i hope this will all be over soon.",jfp0na, Housing ;<br> Health , Health ;<br> Social life , Social life , Social life , Health ;<br> Social life ," SOCIAL LIFE

Looking For Group! [DFRPG],"Hello Everyone!  I'm looking to set up a group to play the Dresden Files Role Playing Game here at UCSC.  It's okay if you don't know what that is, it isn't the biggest game out there.  If the name does sound familiar, but you know you've never heard of the game, then you've probably come across either the \*Dresden Files\* series of novels, or Sci-Fi's short-lived \*Supernatural\* knock-off which borrowed its name.

&amp;#x200B;

Its an Urban Fantasy game, set in and around a city.  Exactly what ""city"" means is left deliberately ambiguous; I kinda like the idea of a city set in and around Santa Cruz/the Monterrey Bay, but if think of something else cool before we start, I'm willing to listen.  The game book recommends we put the setting together as a group, which would probably be most of the first session.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for 2-3 players to join the campaign, who will lead their characters through the adventure, while I manage the rest of the game—making me the GM, or Gamemaster, for those unfamiliar with the jargon.  If you don't have much, or any, experience with Tabletop RPGs, that's fine.  All you need to play is a willingness to engage with the story and your character... and the ability to add/subtract up to 4, but I'm not too worried about that.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're interested, either leave a comment, or send me a message here on reddit.  Unfortunately, the number of players we can have is limited by the number of dice I own.  If you're interested, and have at least four Fudge dice, and/or regular six-sided dice, let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

~~I've already got one interested player, and we're both over at Stevenson.~~  ~~EDIT: I've got four interested players, which is as many as personally have dice for.~~

~~But!  A couple of them mentioned having dice collections of their own, so if you're interested, let me know, and I'll talk to them.~~

**EDIT 2:**  Alright, I was able to manage enough dice for a fifth player, and that spot has been filled.  But I'm going to have to call it off there.  I've never run a game with this many people before, so five players is where I'm going to have to call it.

I'll be visiting both schools soon. Oh and I got into USC too :s Don't hate me, lol. I think I'd defs choose LA over USC though... unless $. Lol.

Thanks a lot for the help :s ",21pk8r, Admissions , Admissions , Admissions , Admissions , Admissions , ADMISSIONS ,['ADMISSIONS'],0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Housing concerns ):,"Hey, so basically I applied for north district a while back, and I was offered a 4 bed 2 bath, but it expired because my parents have been really reluctant to agree to housing earlier because of concerns that COVID would spring back up, classes would be online, and I would be stuck in a contract which I understand but now it’s getting really close to the start of the school year and it’s still in person and I’m super anxious about housing. 

I called the north district place and I’m actually really really high on the waitlist for 4 bed 2 bath, only 2 people would have to re-let their lease for me to be offered a sport, but I’m worried that’s not going to happen. 

It seems the options for housing are really really limited and I don’t know what to do…. Does anyone have any advice?",pahyue, Housing , Housing , Housing , Housing , Housing , HOUSING ,['HOUSING'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Are there any decent study spots on the hill?,"Hey Bruins, 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize in advance if I come off as obnoxious, but I'm growing increasingly frustrated with this problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

My floor promised a quiet lounge but my lounge is almost constantly occupied by people talking loudly and doing almost everything but studying.

&amp;#x200B;

The Study ""quiet room"" is a lovely study spot but it's almost always overflowing with students competing for seats. I can sometimes find a seat around the fire place but I can only study for so long before a loud mob stampedes towards the food area and totally disrupts my concentration.

&amp;#x200B;

My room itself is not suitable for studying. Too much roommate traffic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I could trek over to Powell which is always going to allow for continuous study but (sorry for being that guy) I feel the housing fees I'm paying should at least entitle me to a quiet place to study on the hill. I'm not asking for much, just a QUIET place to study that I can easily find a seat at. ",a39g8r, Unclassified , Housing ;<br> Academic , Social life , Social life , Academic ," ACADEMIC

The process of booking accomodations at SDRC is not very ADHD friendly,"So I've had executive functioning issues for so long now, and I'm extremely slow at test taking, also I panic so much during exams to the point where I need accommodations for my midterms and finals. The problem is, unlike high school where they do everything in high school, over here in college, you have to book everything yourself, you have to send letters to your professors and TAs every quarter letting them know that you need accomodations, and for midterms and finals, you have to book SDRC appointments for EACH exam you have for EACH class, at least 2 WEEKS in advance before the exam, or else you lose your spot. You have to look at exactly what days they're in for each exam, it's such a painful process for a person like me who struggles with significant difficulties with executive functioning, something that people without ADHD or any similar condition would never understand. People who don't have ADHD might laugh and think that ""it should be easy"" but trust me, it's not. Not when you literally have so much work to do in classes, so many assignments, essays, and a lot of material to study on your own, especially because I'm an engineering major. I have to do all of that booking and everything on top of all that work I have just to get the accommodations I need. I couldn't get accommodations for my first physics midterm because I was already so overwhelmed and it was in the midst of while we were suddenly transitioning back to in person learning, it doesn't sit right with me. And I'm sure I'm not the only one with ADHD or any similar challenges who feels this way.",tdgx06, Academic ;<br> Health , Academic ;<br> Health , Academic ;<br> Health , Housing ;<br> Health , Academic ;<br> Health ," HEALTH

Am I being selfish for wanting to go back to uci for the academic year?,"I genuinely cannot focus at home. I’m fortune enough to have my own room, desk, etc. but just being back home puts me on ‘vacation mode’ and I have no motivation to do anything (spring quarter was rough for that reason). However, is going back and living in uci for the year really worth the risk? What if my parents loose their jobs in the near future and instead of helping them financially, my money is going to rent in Irvine? What if I/one of my family members gets sick.....I wouldn’t be able to see them nor help them since I’m 5ish hours away. However, if I do come back to Irvine I’m confident I’ll be able to follow with my classes and do better educationally.

Photo Club @ UCLA,"http://photoclubatucla.com/

Shameless advertisement for the Photography club. We meet on Friday afternoons and do a lot of fun stuff. Previously, there have been photo outings (trips to Venice, Santa Monica beach, a monthly trip to LA Art Walk in Downtown), etc. etc. Our other activities include workshops on certain topics (light-painting, How to use GIMP/Adobe Lightroom/???), some socials, and some guest speakers every now and then (such as this week).

There's also a week during Spring quarter where we rent the gallery in Kerckhoff and have user-submitted photos printed and auctioned off.

There's no real 'difficulty level' that the club is set at, so even if you're bumming around with a simple point-and-shoot Canon like myself, feel free to stop by, say hi, and see what's going on.

I posted the URL because the meeting locations/times have some slight variance in them, but usually the location/time is determined by the Wednesday preceding the meeting.",om5sp, Social life ,, Social life ,, Social life , SOCIAL LIFE ,['SOCIAL LIFE'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Upvote this if you think incoming freshman are dumb,"Seriously, can incoming freshman stop being such newbs? 😂 It's getting soooo annoying seeing incoming freshman *exist*. UCLA should honestly stop admissions indefinitely so that incoming freshman stop bothering us already with the same questions 🙄 I mean, we already know all that stuff. But somehow they keep asking about it. What's the point of asking us questions that we already know the answers to. BORING.

Don't they realize that current students are superior? Stronger, smarter, better looking? We've literally been here longer than they have. Most of us were born before incoming freshman. We have more knowledge. And we're simply better. Our penises are bigger too. They've had more time to develop and grow. It's a fact. It's so irritating that they keep using our subreddit to ask stuff we don't like. They're not real bruins. They need to be banned.

Getting around campus with surfboards,"Hi all, prospective student here again.

I basically just read this posts which were all super helpful about getting around campus.
http://people.ucsc.edu/~jlardino/buses/ 
http://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/1mtsph/let_me_teach_you_about_buses_new_students/

I guess I somewhat understand the etiquette on the buses, but I was just wondering how to get around campus with a 8ft surfboard.

I went on a tour a couple of weeks ago, and I saw people walking, biking, or taking the bus. I don't want to be the asshole with a huge surfboard when 10 people could be riding the bus. So how do I even get around? Should I just bring my mountain bike and attach a surfboard carrier with it? How do I even get to the beach the fastest way possible? 

Also, just wondering, are freshman not allowed to bring their cars because they are not allowed to buy parking permits? I wanted to bring my car up there because I live in Southern California, and wanted to drive home whenever I could when possible. 

Thanks for any input! 

BTW I was just sponsored by a surf company to be a brand ambassador, so that's why I am asking! If any of you surf, I'll hook you up with free clothes and gear if you let me photograph you next fall. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention that I have no experience in riding public transportation here in So Cal, other than the fact that I took the Metro to USC once. But that was it. So go easy on me please! ",2ojv3b,,, Transportation ,, Admissions ," TRANSPORTATION

"Prop 209 is perfectly constitutional while Affirmative Action is unconstitutional. Can someone please explain what all the hype is about? (If you're going to downvote, at least give a reason why).","Please explain why student's are rallying and feel like they are attacked. I am a student of color and I don't support implementing affirmative action or bashing on Prop 209. Admissions should be fair and race, sex, and ethnicity should not be taken into consideration. 

I found this on Wikipedia:

""Since the passage of Proposition 209, higher graduation rates have been posted at University of California schools, which led opponents of affirmative action to suggest a causal link between Proposition 209 and a better-prepared student body. The African American graduation rate at the University of California, Berkeley increased by 6.5 percent, and rose even more dramatically, from 26 percent to 52 percent, at the University of California, San Diego.

While African American graduation rates at UC Berkeley increased by 6.5 percent, the enrollment rates dropped significantly. Criticism was made of the fact that of the 4,422 students in UCLA's freshman class of 2006, only 100 (2.26%) were African American. In fact, opponents of Proposition 209 note that there are greater disparities in elite education in the post-Proposition 209 era due to decreased African American and Latino enrollment. Proponents, on the other hand, note that Asian American enrollment rates dramatically increased at a majority of UC campuses.""

I think having high graduation rates are better than high admission rates. ",129pmw,, Social life , Social life ,, Social life , SOCIAL LIFE ,['SOCIAL LIFE'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

2nd Year Transfer - A Rant ?,"Hello!!! I hope everyone is doing well. I have been on this reddit for awhile, but never got around to making a dedicated UCI account, hence the newness of my account. I am a 2nd year transfer (4th year), although this feels like my first year at UCI!! In fact, for those who are lucky enough to be here since your freshman year, know that I envy you LMAO. This is my first time at ""real college"" since imo community college was the worst experience thus far. I like being anon because I can finally shout to a void that I saved money but hated every minute of CC, and would only recommend it if it's your only option. Anyways, it's simple to say that my journey through college has been less than ideal. But I couldn't be more happy to finally be here! 

Besides my happiness, and being proud but also feeling lost because I often wonder how I even got into UCI in the first place, I feel so alone. Like the pandemic alone was isolating, but walking on campus completely alone and unattached is a whole new feeling of emptiness.

I am involved on quite a few endeavors on campus, but I don't really know everyone well or have friends. I have no deep connections with anyone, and it hurts. I don't know, it's like those friends I do have are the ones from classes etc, but I don't necessarily feel like they are people I could tell my problems to (hence why I am here ahah), or casually ask to hangout. I am a commuter, so on top of not living near campus, I often am worried about the drive home etc, rather than staying longer to study and stuff. 

I really am not sure what else to say. I've intended on posting here for awhile ironically, though I'm not even sure if this will reach people. I really enjoy campus, and stuff but god **I literally don't think I've ever felt so alone** LMAOO. If I am being totally honest, I feel like my only friends on campus are those little robots idek what they're called because I've never ordered from one. But when I see them like backing up or stuck I just think to myself, me too little buddy. (Also quite possibly the stupidest question, but how do those work? Is someone controlling it or is it literally a robot?) 

I really would love to spend more time on campus. Find more secret study spaces for when I am there, go through the student center (i've only ever been to the Zot &amp; Go for some snacks lol), go to the pub, go to a basketball game, go to the arc (although I've never been to a gym and am quite shy haha), you know just all the fun things that typical UCI students do. Although, being shy I am super scared to try these things alone, as I just know I would feel so awk, like I would love to go to a basketball game, but alone ?? LMAO, I feel like I can see the ""step out of your comfort zone"" comments coming already, but please know I am like a senior with the mindset and experience of a freshman here (that's what 2 years at a CC and first year online will do) so please be kind &gt;.&gt;

Also not to grasp at sticks here, but the dating scene? I've never really dated in my life but was planning too when I got to UCI. But now LMAO, it's like I go to UCI for a few hours for classes/clubs etc and I'm like how does everyone do it? (sorry dating novice lmaoo)

Also, is everyone sick? Is everyone okay? I hear that something is going around, and it's been knocking people out of my classes. Please make sure you all take care of yourselves, and I hope you feel better soon!!

Also shoutout to all the homies on this reddit page, because I learn so much from all of you!!! Literally, I learned how to register, classes, parking, professors, research - you name it! So thank you for helping people out like me!!!

Anyways, sorry for the rant, but thank you for taking the time to read it as I super appreciate it. If you have any advice or anything on how to feel like a true anteater please let me know. I hope everyone has a great week 7 :)",qresle,, Social life , Social life ,, Academic ;<br> Social life ," SOCIAL LIFE

New app for incoming freshman,"Just posted to the UCI facebook group:

""Hi! I built an app to bring UCI's Class of 2018 a little closer last year and updated it to work for you guys. 500 of us signed up last year and it worked awesome! Go ahead and fill out your profile and classes and check out the UCI life hacks we're putting together! The app will become more useful when 150 of you have signed up! smile emoticon It's a one-click signup!""

http://2019.anteater.me

""** When 150 of you have signed up:
*The app will unlock the Explore tab- you can look through all the other Anteaters' profiles and learn about them, make friends, choose roommates and talk to loads of like minded people before even getting here! 
*The Stats tab- when enough data is collected, the app will pull all the data you guys have entered and show you breakdowns of ethnicities, sexes, residences, locations, schools and majors and the most popular boy and girl names! Last year this was as accurate as UCI's very own CDS data.
*The Class Explorer- as you guys add your classes, the app will group you all into classes and show you the other anteaters who are in your lectures and discussions: form study groups or make friends with people who are gonna be in your classes!
The Life Hacks page gives you discounts to some of the most popular apps on campus, teaches you some of the lessons we wished we knew during our first quarter, shows you what you can do with that @uci.edu  email address and shows you how brag-worthy this institution is, you have a lot to be proud of! Congratulations!
As well as this we're putting together a blog to give you guys a good idea of UCI and the whole college transition process as a whole! Add yourself to our mailing list (at the bottom of the ""Update your profile"" page) to know when this is ready as well as get a notification to when 150 of you sign up!

UCI Fin Aid Bank Account,"So I receive financial aid from UCI and at the beginning of every quarter I always get a bit of money deposited into my bank account (wells fargo) via direct deposit. However, a few weeks ago I closed this bank account(wells fargo). So now I’m worried that either the money I’m supposed to receive either won’t come at all, or will come slowly via check. Therefore I was wondering how do I change the direct deposit bank account for my financial aid (I’d like to change it to my bank of America).

University Concert Choir (Music 1C) Audition Question.,"I'm not sure how to audition for Music 1C. I was planning on doing an in person audition on the first day of instruction but Omicron screwed that up. The online audition information on the [website](https://music.ucsc.edu/ensembles/audition-schedule#choir) is from last quarter, so I'm not sure if I should follow the directions from last quarter or wait for it to be updated. If anyone has any information about this please let me know. Thanks in advance. :D

p.s. I'm going to email the director about this and will update this post.

Off-Campus v. On-Campus,"I personally want to live off-campus next year, I'm looking for houses with two other people and hoping to find one for four or six people, but my folks are concerned with my financial aid going down, specifically my University Grant which is 10k and a huuuuuge reason why I'm at UCSC to begin with. They're also concerned about me being less academically successful having to commute to campus and keeping up with the responsibilities of renting a place off-campus with a bunch of 19 year olds.

From your experience, are their concerns warranted? I really think living off-campus will be better for my mental health; The dorms at Porter are giving my well-being a run for its money.",4666g1,, Housing , Housing ,, Housing , HOUSING ,['HOUSING'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

How exactly does the university plan to replace that many TAs?,"Look at the logic of this. As noted in the email, the COLA strike has placed “significant stress” on the university and its students. Those TAs not working has caused this much disruption to classes, and this was supposedly only temporary with the possibility of a return to normal should negotiations resume.

Now imagine that disruption being permanent. Because that is what’s supposedly about to happen here. How does the university plan to fill in the empty positions?

I've never had to buy a book at UCI before because I usually get it online whether it's through amazon or a legally questionable source. The book I've been using recently for one of my classes is the wrong edition and it's been working well all the way up until now (week 10). We have an assignment due on the day of our final and it requires using the book, but the part I need isn't in my edition of the book. Also, I have no friends or even acquaintances in this class. It's a really easy class so I usually don't even show up. Anyways, would it be weird if I went to the bookstore, found this book, and took a picture of ~15 pages from it? Are the books easily accessible there? Where even are the books lol.

Prop. 30 and 38 are obviously related to education funding, but all the measure have an impact. If they have a cost or generate revenue, then they effect education funding.

[Read about them.](http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/) You also got that voter guide in the mail. Read it, just the summaries if that's all the time you have, but more is better.

All the propositions will effect how much you, your parents, and your younger siblings pay for college and how much the education quality changes.

2. How easy is the process if you're going in solo? I'm planning on going random, but I'm afraid I'll end up living with people with completely different lifestyle preferences. If it helps, I'm trying to get into a 1BD/2P or a 2BD/4P (though at the end of the day I guess I'm fine with any room type as long as I get decent roommates haha).

THE B*TCH IN ANTHRO ADVISING,"is it legal that UCR has indefinitely denied my request to take ARC035? I'm an anthro major and after going to Kim Etzeilw..(whatever her name is) repeatedly my first year explaining to her that I need this class in order to do pre-med reqs, she failed to help me in every way until it was way too late. Now I can't take any math/science class at UCR or even switch into another major. I'm beyond pissed bc i feel like i knew what i needed to do and she denied me help. I petitioned with the academic affairs office and the indefinitely denied me. What do I do? I'm going into my 3rd year so I don't wanna bust my chops just yet but I promise on my last day her I will go in and yell at her lazy ass.

EDIT: I mean I don't mean to be annoying or seem as if I'm trying to find fault with her but she seriously sucks at her job. She doesn't care about her students at all. I hope more people find the courage to come forward and speak up about her because when I was a first/second year I was scared of ruining my reputation and such but now I can see how wrong it is of her. Just by emailing the other advisors in the office regarding other issues, I could tell the difference of how they perceive their job and care about it. School officials need to know about her and the mess she's putting students through. She's supposed to guide us, to ADVISE us but she fails to do so every time. So please, if you have ever been affected by her, please contact me and I'll give you the email to her supervisor and hopefully we can make a difference for future anthro/soc students.",8rf6kn,, Academic , Academic , Academic , Academic , ACADEMIC ,['ACADEMIC'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Stats Major Who Can't Study Abroad: A Sad Rant,"I am a rising third year and today sadly realized the study abroad dreams I've had for years are slipping out of my reach. Just for context: I am on track to start the Stats 102 series this coming year, which I believe is quite normal. This means I can't study abroad until Winter 2023 at the earliest since I would have to take the 102 series and currently study abroad fall programs are mostly cancelled. I could take 102C over the summer, but I'm planning to get a summer internship and unfortunately getting a job and that work experience is more important than me going abroad. Also, pretty sure I couldn't afford housing/tuition costs over the summer on top of not having internship money coming in anyways. 

I was supposed to study abroad the summer after my freshman year which I believe is basically the earliest time you can go for most programs but COVID hit so that didn't happen. Of course that ended up taking up a lot of my time in college and still is, but I had been holding out hope for Winter/Spring 2023 (my last quarters as an undergraduate student... wow COVID has taken forever). But now I realize that means I can't make graduation which just isn't possible for a first-generation student like me. Also, my parents' first (and only other child) graduated in COVID... so he didn't get a normal graduation either. Yes, I'd rather celebrate mine and my parents accomplishments on that special day but it sucks that I have to sacrifice the thing that was the ""light"" at the end of the tunnel for me during COVID.  


The kicker is the program I want to do starts in March rather than January like a lot of other semester programs. My solution was maybe I could walk in Winter (still kinda don't feel great about that though honestly because of the aforementioned reasons why graduation is very important to my family) but I would have to take winter quarter off because I planned it out that I would graduate after taking Stats 102C. Not even sure I'm allowed to take a quarter off right before graduating and then not even being at UCLA because I'm shipping off to another country. I checked if going in my last quarter was even allowed since there is a residency requirement to graduate (taking a certain number of you last units at UCLA), and they said it was ok to go, but I kind of doubt they'd let me do it after I had already just taken the Winter 2023 quarter off. I would have been really sad if they said I couldn't because then literally the only time for any Class of 2023 student to study abroad would be Spring 2022 and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of those programs are cancelled due to COVID. 

I wish I could go in Fall 2022 but I need Stats 102C. I keep beating myself up because Stats 102C only has Stats 102A as a requirement and doesn't need Stats 102B but it's not offered Spring anyways so I can't take it until next Fall. I keep telling myself ""Why didn't you just take Stats 102A last year?"" But obviously I didn't know AND if I'm going to be honest I couldn't have handled it as an extra class during online learning. It just sucks because I thought I was so smart in taking the 101 series as a sophomore so I could take 140s earlier but now it's all in vain anyways. I love the Stats major. I've had great experiences with professors and the classes are so interesting. But god I want to throw up. When I was manically crying about this situation a few hours ago, I wanted to just drop the major and become a minor but obviously that's insane for me to do when I'm one class away. But god it was so tempting to think about. 

I don't know man. I just wished some rules could change and there could be some leeway because as someone in Class of 2023 I'm like there's no way this is just me? The number of people who are going abroad from our class is probably way down since we can only basically go as seniors and there's all this red tape for seniors. I literally planned this since I was a freshman and it's still falling apart. I feel like people who planned 1-2 years in advanced just cannot make it. 

I know this is first-world problems and people are probably thinking that some people were never able to afford study abroad anyways (that's actually not true, my program would cost me the same as going to UCLA so recommend underclassmen research into it) but it still makes me really sad. I don't even know if this post makes sense but thanks for reading it. And my fellow people who lost out on study abroad due to COVID wya let's cry together.",p9s5yv,, Social life , Academic , Financial ;<br> Academic , Academic ," ACADEMIC

UCLA's Zombie Survival Plan,"This is sort of a x-post from the /r/ucla Facebook group, but it's very relevant. I was directed to post it here! 

*What's the general consensus on the zombie survival plan among Bruins?*

Personally, I think there are two plans everyone should have: the initial, reactionary plan and the long-term survival plan. The later would consist of hunkering down, gathering survivors, and just trying to survive. The former should consist of escaping campus to a more defensible area and developing a strategy for life after infection.

Anyone have any thoughts on the matter? ",k7s8f,, Social life , Social life , Health , Social life ," SOCIAL LIFE

I'm a potential 2020-21 Freshman (mentioned in my previous posts) and I'm deciding between Irvine and Davis. For me it's really come down to the campus life and cultures between the two. I've lived in NorCal for most of my life and I don't know much about SoCal culture, although it's always interested me. I feel like I really don't know much about what's it like to be in UC Irvine. I'm a pretty social person and I feel like I'll be fine wherever I decide to go, but I just want to know what's the best fit for me.

Room for 1 more (girl) for Stevenson Apartments group,"So some friends of mine had a girl drop out of their their group literally last minute (yesterday, hours before they had to turn in their housing stuff) and that puts them obviously in a shitty situation. 

So here's the details: they're group consists of 3 guys and two girls (the girls are great friends of mine, all the guys are respectable and nice, by no means creeps or anything), I believe only 4 are Stevenson students, one Cowell i think, and all freshman, and last off, the position would be to live in a triple with the two girls, both are very clean, nice girls. So if you or anyone you know might be interested in this, comment and I'll set something up! 

I know this isn't the greatest of opportunities of all time, but I thought I would post here and see if anyone was interested or not, none of this really influences me much, just trying to help out some friends. ",t1z9l,, Housing , Housing ,, Housing , HOUSING ,['HOUSING'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

does anyone know if the man at UTC that replaces phone screens is reliable,"title, i dont really know how to word what im asking LMAO but basically 

i very unfortunately cracked my entire phone screen bc i forgot to buy a screen protector for it and the entire screen is full of cracks. i didnt get apple care for my phone so replacing the screen is $329 before tax bc i have a very new phone, and i was speaking to the guy at UTC that has the little kiosk with all the phone cases and saw he was advertising screen repairs as one of his services as well.

after speaking with him he told me the cost of my repair would be $249, which is basically $100 cheaper than what i would pay with apple. he said he just needed a $100 deposit and then i could come back the next day and have my screen repaired in 20-30 minutes.

what i wanted to ask is if anyone has ever had a repair completed by this man before? even if you haven't had a screen repair, have you ever bought anything/had anything else repaired by this man before? would you recommend going through him? he seemed really nice but i also want to make sure  i dont fuck up my phone even more before i spend a lot of money fixing the screen. also, sorry if ""the man at utc at the kiosk"" isn't descriptive enough, i didnt get his name and i feel like i always see him there so thats why im referring to him so generally. anyway, i would appreciate any input if anyone has any, thank you very much!!",10jxvqo,, Social life , Social life ,, Social life ;<br> Marketplace," SOCIAL LIFE

How to get out of going back to an in-person class:(,"Only one of my 3 classes has transitioned back to in-person this quarter, which means technically I only have to be on campus on Thursdays and Fridays for the rest of this quarter. My house is one hour and a half away from UCLA. I do not want to move back into my dorm for many reasons: I don't get along with my roommates, I don't want to have to pay so much for housing and dining to be there only 2 days a week (we don't get refunds but I am thinking of cancelling my housing contract), and my brother currently isn't mentally in the right place so I am afraid to leave him by himself (my parents are not in the USA right now). Also, I don't have parking at UCLA and I need my car to drive to my off-campus volunteer shift on Saturdays. I don't want to have to pay for Uber as it adds up nor do I want to pay for daily parking at UCLA (that can get expensive, too). Basically, I am not financially nor emotionally in the place to go back to campus right now. It just isn't ideal and it's stressing me out just thinking that I have to be back by Thursday. Is there any way I can get out of having to go back? Online was working out perfectly for me throughout this whole quarter... there are only a few weeks left and it sucks to have to go back for only two days when I could easily stay at home and be in the right mindset. I was wondering if any of you found a way to stay home/online or what you guys have said to your professors to get permission to stay at home even though your class has transitioned to in-person.

Avoid the Palms on University!,"Avoid this place. The management is incredibly sketchy and will screw you out of your money. I lived here for two years unfortunately when I was a student at UCR, the first time I signed a ten month lease because school did not start until September and I was not going to be in Riverside for the summer. My living experience was alright, other than a few minor complaints I liked the place. Then, towards the end of my term they started suckering us in with promotions to resign, such as $300 gift cards and mini fridges if you resign a lease. So I figured why not, I'm here for another year anyway. What a mistake that was. For the last month of my 12 month lease that I signed, they made me move out on June 18th because I had moved in on September 18th two years ago. My new lease did not start until July 1st, effectively rendering me homeless for two weeks. They also made me pay a full month's rent for July. When I asked the management at the leasing office if I could stay the extra two weeks, they told me I would be charged $100 per day if I wished to do so. After two years of being a good tenant! The management is notoriously shady, there have been lots of complaints about them from the other reviewers and the UCR community as a whole. Now, management aside, onto the apartments themselves.

I guess they're in a good location, and the rooms are somewhat spacious. It's nice that they are furnished and that utilities are included, so there's that. However, let it be known that although the building is close (within walking distance) to campus, the neighborhood is very sketchy. I would not like to walk around there at night, crackheads, gangbangers, and hookers patrol the streets (especially the Thrifty gas station across the street) at night. One of the buildings of the complex is leased out to a local trade school for their dorms, and the tenants of that building are scary people for the most part. Lots of drugs, lots of gang related activity. Naked crackheads regularly break into the pool and jacuzzi to bathe. They often have sex in there as well or pass out, sometimes with needles on them. When I lived there there was an incident in which a local degenerate broke into the computer lab every night to view child pornography. The complex is not at all safe, it's in a notoriously seedy part of the city and sketchy people are free to roam around the apartments at nights. I heard gunshots and drunken gang fights coming from the street at night when I lived there. There was even an incident in which a tenant got her car blown up in the parking structure in an apparent hit attempt. The management was extremely sketchy about it, they tried as hard as they could to cover it up. There is almost no guest parking and guests will be towed within minutes if they park anywhere else. I can't stress how seedy and awful this place is.

Pros: Decent apartments, relatively good rates which include utilities.

Cons: Shyster management who operate the complex like the mafia, extremely dangerous and unsafe at night, filthy pool, loud, sketchy tenants, plus apparently since I moved out the summer of 2014 I hear they have rats in the parking lot area.",2r8sjg,, Housing , Housing ,, Housing , HOUSING ,['HOUSING'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

APARTMENT LEASE CANCELLATION,"Hi everyone, a lot of students are having trouble canceling their lease at various off-campus apartment complexes (University Village Towers, Grandmarc, Doug Wetton owned Properties, etc.) Many of us signed leases for the upcoming school year prior to the announcement that the majority of fall quarter would be online. There are also a lot of students who were unable to break their leases once COVID-19 broke out and spring quarter went online. Personally, I was told that if I wanted to break my lease I had to pay for the remaining months of rent on my lease even if the unit is empty. It's unfortunate that these corporations are trying to capitalize off of struggling college students and a pandemic. It's clear that they have no intention of making accommodations so we NEED to bring this to the attention of Riverside city and county officials.

"UCLA recreation, you did it again you son of a ...","Hello everyone, first off please let's have a healthy discussion. So long story short I've been working out at Drake stadium for the past 3 years ( I do calisthenics and bodyweight exercises ). Around this time a year, as it gets really hot outside, most people working out at Drake ( runners, people going up the stairs, and people working out at the rings and pull up bars ) take their t-shirt off and work out normally without any trouble whatsoever. Today, some ""supervisor"" that I've never seen in the entire 3 years I've been working out at Drake came up to everyone at 4PM under scorching heat and forced everyone working-out/running without a t-shirt to put it on. Bear in mind that one of the reason most people that work outdoors don't wear a t-shirt is because it gets really hot this time a year and you get all sticky and uncomfortable. On top of that, Drake stadium hours are 3PM - 8PM since I'm assuming recreation doesn't want to spend money turning on the lights so we are forced to workout under the sun. 
Why do you think this is enforced, does it make sense to you at all? One of the pleasures of working out outside is to be in an open space getting some sun on your skin and I don't really understand why this is enforced / why this is the first time in 3 years this actually happens.

Again, please let's have a healthy, respectful discussion below.",w89852,,,,, Social life , SOCIAL LIFE ,['SOCIAL LIFE'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Grades,"Hello,
I need advice on what to do. As you all know grades have been posted and in a particular course I had a letter grade of an A throughout the quarter.  I never felt like I did bad in the course up until I saw my grade last night when grades were posted and it was a D+. This brought great fraustartion to me because for our last two assignments I basically failed them this including the final. No comment was made on why I got such a low grade. I personally don’t think I deserved such a low grade and I know this can sound like complaining but it really isn’t given how I feel about the course overall. I know when I do wrong in a course and this just seemed odd to me. There had been an event that previously happened with this professor throughout the course when an assignment was due and she’d give me a failing grade. Id compare my assignment with other peers and they had less work than me and an A was given to them. I emailed the professor about the situation and she did allow me to resubmit my assignment exclaiming I was missing some sort of thing here and there but it felt more like she was just being a bit harder on me. This felt the same with the last assignment we did but I never emailed her asking about the situation as just seeing grades yesterday. I failed my final which was an essay but no comments were made why and also a project (same thing). Another situation happened where throughout the quarter I got COVID and could not attend a class, emailed her if I can submit the in class group work and she said one class attendance group work would get dropped. She later said it wouldn’t. 

The point of my email is I genuinely feel like the professor graded me much tougher or in a way that there’s been some biased (not sure if this even happens). I’m not sure if there was a problem but I felt odd about this through the quarter. I emailed the professor last night asking if anything can be done. I can take a failing grade if I did wrong but I want to know why I got such a failing grade if it comes to that. I deep down in my gut don’t think I did this bad in a course. I know you may all thing I’m complaining but I genuinely need advice and feel this way for a reason. 

My main question is does anyone have any advice on what can be done? Can I speak to someone about the way I felt throughout this quarter? Can anything be done to have a meeting with the professor? Does she have to respond to my emails? This is giving me lots of anxiety and I want to know if there is a solution to this.",zo720h," academic ,  health "," academic ,  health ", academic , academic , academic ,ACADEMIC,['ACADEMIC'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What's the transfer process like?,"Hello,

I'm going to apply to transfer this year, however, I have some questions regarding what the transfer process is like, I do apologize for the many questions but here are my questions:

1. Once you have been admitted to UCI is it stressful? What was the process like for you when you switch from CC to UCI?
2. Are you allowed to take CC classes during the process of transferring or the summer before entering for the fall semester? Also, how does this work in terms of submitting summer courses before going into the fall semester?
3. Can you apply to be a double major once you get in? If so do you have to finish the pre-reqs the moment you apply or can you finish during the summer before entering the fall semester? Also how difficult is it to be approved by the colleges to double major if you were trying to aim for a computer-related degree?
4. When you start registering for classes how competitive is it? Like do the students who have attended UCI during their freshmen and sophomore year have priority for classes compared to the transfer class?
5. Can you still be able to take CC classes while being at UCI? Also does taking a CC class to be considered part of the units you are taking at UCI? (Ex: I have 15 units in UCI, but in CC I have a class that's 5 units would they add those together as a total of 20 units or would they keep it separate?)

I would like to hear about the difference between these majors from different campus and the pros and cons of Business Economics in UCI.  Also, I realized that Business Admin major does not offer TAG, what are the difference between this major and Business Economics? How competitive and difficult is Business Economics major?

Why We Need to Stay Online (for the rest of the quarter at least),"EDIT: here's a petition for having a remote quarter! [https://chng.it/yRsgqYFbZN](https://chng.it/yRsgqYFbZN) 

* if we properly quarantine now, we can be in-person later for longer. if we take a risk now, we may not EVER be in-person for the REST of our college careers.
* we haven't returned to campus yet, and the number of cases at UCI on a SINGLE day has already exceeded the number of cases during fall quarter AS A WHOLE. (source: [https://uci.edu/coronavirus/dashboard/index.php](https://uci.edu/coronavirus/dashboard/index.php) )
* UCI's in-person instruction depends on Orange and neighboring LA county. LA county so far has \~110k new cases/week.. as opposed to nearby CA counties with \~5k-15k cases/week. This trend probably won't change by the 28th or maybe even by the end of Feb (aka almost all of this quarter). (source: [https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/coronavirus-map/](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/coronavirus-map/) )
* not enough isolation beds available as cases rise. even if we take a risk and start in-person instruction, where will you go if (when) you get sick? where will your roommates go? your professors and TAs? all your close contacts?
* the honor system... is not reliable. although it is the best that UCI/other colleges can do given their resources and power, it is not enough to stay safe. and that's okay. but we must acknowledge it.
* international students (\~20% of student body) may not legally be able to even return to campus
* we come back in-person right in the middle of midterms? sounds real fun. not only do professors have to adjust their curriculum to suit in-person demands, but students have to adjust too. some students have to move in to a whole new dorm.
* this is the global graph for covid cases since 2020 (start of pandemic) to 2022 (now). this should be enough information for you. (the reason i put the global chart, is because we have students from all around the world)

https://preview.redd.it/7omasr1mrra81.png?width=1454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc3fec52c38223ce95d5485ecf0b707360a3a900

* i understand this has caused a lot of stress.. but what is even more stressful is testing positive for covid/spreading it to your loved ones.

**THE SOLUTION.** (since we are all focused on the issues and not enough of us are focusing on moving forward)

* (based on the safety regulations at the time), we should allow students to make their individual choice of whether to go in person/stay remote
* ALL professors should be given the option to move their classes online or remain in person. either way, they should give a remote option to students who prefer to stay at home (whether international/immunocompromised/or simply safe)
* anyone impacted by the pandemic with regards to income/assets/access to education+wifi+etc, should be considered by UCI. perhaps funds that were allocated to some in-person facilities should be allocated towards these individuals.
* in terms of being refunded for our housing fees and things.... we should all be refunded our money or at least partially, but idk if that's going to happen. someone should start a whole new post for that.

**Thank you to all the professors for being so flexible and spending your winter break re-arranging ALL your curriculum for your students. Thank you to any medical staff/frontline healthcare workers who can't even afford/choose to quarantine while the rest of us are sitting here and debating whether or not we should.**

I'm tired of paying for the zones and moving my car whenever I need to go to one part of campus. How strongly would you recommend bikes?

How much of a hassle is it riding your bike to your building, parking and locking it, then heading to class? How difficult is it cruising along Aldrich with those slopes and hills? Do you get super sweaty heading into lecture? Lol. For all bikers out there, how much did you pay for your bike?  Should I just stick to a cheap $300 cruiser or go full fledged mountain bike?

Yeah, the COVID data looks a bit grim right now, but until we get the same email you get, we won’t know whether the whole quarter is going to be online.

It’s interesting that your professor said that. We still don’t know whether the whole quarter is going to be online.

Your course load is fine if you manage your time.

You might get a ticket, and you might not. No one here can tell you for sure.

You might get off the waitlist, and you might not. No one here can tell you for sure.

Some people did well in that class, and others didn’t. We can’t tell you for sure how you’ll do or what your experience will be.

COVID continues to put a ton of us in a really awkward position wrt housing, transportation, and a hundred other factors. You are not alone, and we hope things work out, but none of us has definitive answers that can help you one way or the other.

Major change to business Econ?,"So I’ve been thinking that I want to change my major from biosci to business econ.

I suck at chem, and bio is kinda boring so I’m struggling to even have good grades, plus, I think I’ll get kicked out soon since my biosci gpa is low (academic probation)? For business econ, I know business admin is out of the question, so would business econ help me in creating my own business? 

So, is it easy to get into business econ? I have a 2.3 GPA atm (depression hit really bad last year), and I’m currently a second year. I haven’t taken the required classes yet, but I’m not sure where to go from here. I also set up a meeting with a biosci counselor on the 5th of December.

We will have two cosmetic chemists as guest speakers: Nasrat Hamid from John Paul Mitchell Systems and Amanda Lam from Azelis. Nasrat will be doing a live demo of an emulsion formulation.

She will also present about the science behind emulsions. Amanda will be giving tips and tricks on getting into the cosmetic chemistry industry after graduating and connecting with industry professionals!

We have around 15 more spots available and want to fill it up. The link to the RSVP form is: https://bit.ly/3RTY5Lx
